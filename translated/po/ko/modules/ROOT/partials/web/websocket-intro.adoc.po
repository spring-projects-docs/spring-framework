"The WebSocket protocol, {rfc-site}/rfc6455[RFC 6455], provides a "
"standardized way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel "
"between client and server over a single TCP connection. It is a different "
"TCP protocol from HTTP but is designed to work over HTTP, using ports 80 and "
"443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules."

"WebSocket for internal applications within the firewall is a more "
"straightforward decision than it is for public facing applications."
