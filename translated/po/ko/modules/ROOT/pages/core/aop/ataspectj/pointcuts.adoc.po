"Pointcuts determine join points of interest and thus enable us to control "
"when advice runs. Spring AOP only supports method execution join points for "
"Spring beans, so you can think of a pointcut as matching the execution of "
"methods on Spring beans. A pointcut declaration has two parts: a signature "
"comprising a name and any parameters and a pointcut expression that "
"determines exactly which method executions we are interested in. In the "
"@AspectJ annotation-style of AOP, a pointcut signature is provided by a "
"regular method definition, and the pointcut expression is indicated by using "
"the `@Pointcut` annotation (the method serving as the pointcut signature "
"must have a `void` return type)."
