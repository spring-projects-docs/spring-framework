"In addition to declaring aspects in your configuration by using either "
"`<aop:config>` or `<aop:aspectj-autoproxy>`, it is also possible to "
"programmatically create proxies that advise target objects. For the full "
"details of Spring's AOP API, see the xref:core/aop-api.adoc[next "
"chapter]. Here, we want to focus on the ability to automatically create "
"proxies by using @AspectJ aspects."
