"Once you have decided that an aspect is the best approach for implementing a "
"given requirement, how do you decide between using Spring AOP or AspectJ and "
"between the Aspect language (code) style, the @AspectJ annotation style, or "
"the Spring XML style? These decisions are influenced by a number of factors "
"including application requirements, development tools, and team familiarity "

"Use the simplest thing that can work. Spring AOP is simpler than using full "
"AspectJ, as there is no requirement to introduce the AspectJ compiler / "
"weaver into your development and build processes. If you only need to advise "
"the execution of operations on Spring beans, Spring AOP is the right "
"choice. If you need to advise objects not managed by the Spring container "
"(such as domain objects, typically), you need to use AspectJ. You also need "
"to use AspectJ if you wish to advise join points other than simple method "
"executions (for example, field get or set join points and so on)."

"When you use AspectJ, you have the choice of the AspectJ language syntax "
"(also known as the \"code style\") or the @AspectJ annotation style. If "
"aspects play a large role in your design, and you are able to use the "
"https://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/[AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT)] plugin for "
"Eclipse, the AspectJ language syntax is the preferred option. It is cleaner "
"and simpler because the language was purposefully designed for writing "
"aspects. If you do not use Eclipse or have only a few aspects that do not "
"play a major role in your application, you may want to consider using the "
"@AspectJ style, sticking with regular Java compilation in your IDE, and "
"adding an aspect weaving phase to your build script."

"The XML style may be most familiar to existing Spring users, and it is "
"backed by genuine POJOs. When using AOP as a tool to configure enterprise "
"services, XML can be a good choice (a good test is whether you consider the "
"pointcut expression to be a part of your configuration that you might want "
"to change independently). With the XML style, it is arguably clearer from "
"your configuration which aspects are present in the system."

"The XML style has two disadvantages. First, it does not fully encapsulate "
"the implementation of the requirement it addresses in a single place. The "
"DRY principle says that there should be a single, unambiguous, authoritative "
"representation of any piece of knowledge within a system. When using the XML "
"style, the knowledge of how a requirement is implemented is split across the "
"declaration of the backing bean class and the XML in the configuration "
"file. When you use the @AspectJ style, this information is encapsulated in a "
"single module: the aspect. Secondly, the XML style is slightly more limited "
"in what it can express than the @AspectJ style: Only the \"singleton\" "
"aspect instantiation model is supported, and it is not possible to combine "
"named pointcuts declared in XML.  For example, in the @AspectJ style you can "
"write something like the following:"

"The @AspectJ style supports additional instantiation models and richer "

"beyond simple configuration of enterprise services."
