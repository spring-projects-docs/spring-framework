"Spring AOP can also use CGLIB proxies. This is necessary to proxy classes "
"rather than interfaces. By default, CGLIB is used if a business object does "
"not implement an interface. As it is good practice to program to interfaces "
"rather than classes, business classes normally implement one or more "
"business interfaces. It is possible to xref:core/aop/proxying.adoc[force the "
"use of CGLIB], in those (hopefully rare) cases where you need to advise a "
"method that is not declared on an interface or where you need to pass a "
"proxied object to a method as a concrete type."
