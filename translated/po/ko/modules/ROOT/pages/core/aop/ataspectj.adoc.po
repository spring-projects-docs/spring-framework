"@AspectJ refers to a style of declaring aspects as regular Java classes "
"annotated with annotations. The @AspectJ style was introduced by the "
"{aspectj-site}[AspectJ project] as part of the AspectJ 5 release. Spring "
"interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5, using a library supplied by "
"AspectJ for pointcut parsing and matching. The AOP runtime is still pure "
"Spring AOP, though, and there is no dependency on the AspectJ compiler or "
"weaver."
