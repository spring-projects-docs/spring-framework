"To use @AspectJ aspects in a Spring configuration, you need to enable Spring "
"support for configuring Spring AOP based on @AspectJ aspects and "
"auto-proxying beans based on whether or not they are advised by those "
"aspects. By auto-proxying, we mean that, if Spring determines that a bean is "
"advised by one or more aspects, it automatically generates a proxy for that "
"bean to intercept method invocations and ensures that advice is run as "
"needed."
