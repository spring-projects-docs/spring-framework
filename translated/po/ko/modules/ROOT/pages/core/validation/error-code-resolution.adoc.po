"We covered data binding and validation. This section covers outputting "
"messages that correspond to validation errors. In the example shown in the "
"xref:core/validation/validator.adoc[preceding section], we rejected the "
"`name` and `age` fields. If we want to output the error messages by using a "
"`MessageSource`, we can do so using the error code we provide when rejecting "
"the field ('name' and 'age' in this case). When you call (either directly, "
"or indirectly, by using, for example, the `ValidationUtils` class) "
"`rejectValue` or one of the other `reject` methods from the `Errors` "
"interface, the underlying implementation not only registers the code you "
"passed in but also registers a number of additional error codes. The "
"`MessageCodesResolver` determines which error codes the `Errors` interface "
"registers. By default, the `DefaultMessageCodesResolver` is used, which (for "
"example) not only registers a message with the code you gave but also "
"registers messages that include the field name you passed to the reject "
"method. So, if you reject a field by using `rejectValue(\"age\", "
"\"too.darn.old\")`, apart from the `too.darn.old` code, Spring also "
"registers `too.darn.old.age` and `too.darn.old.age.int` (the first includes "
"the field name and the second includes the type of the field). This is done "
"as a convenience to aid developers when targeting error messages."
