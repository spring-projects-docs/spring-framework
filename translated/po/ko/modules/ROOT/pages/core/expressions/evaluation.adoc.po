"It is possible to configure the SpEL expression parser by using a parser "
"configuration object "
"(`org.springframework.expression.spel.SpelParserConfiguration`). The "
"configuration object controls the behavior of some of the expression "
"components. For example, if you index into a collection and the element at "
"the specified index is `null`, SpEL can automatically create the "
"element. This is useful when using expressions made up of a chain of "
"property references. Similarly, if you index into a collection and specify "
"an index that is greater than the current size of the collection, SpEL can "
"automatically grow the collection to accommodate that index. In order to add "
"an element at the specified index, SpEL will try to create the element using "
"the element type's default constructor before setting the specified "
"value. If the element type does not have a default constructor, `null` will "
"be added to the collection. If there is no built-in converter or custom "
"converter that knows how to set the value, `null` will remain in the "
"collection at the specified index. The following example demonstrates how to "
"automatically grow a `List`."
