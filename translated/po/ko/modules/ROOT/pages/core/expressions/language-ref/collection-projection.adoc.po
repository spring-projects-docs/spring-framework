"Projection lets a collection drive the evaluation of a sub-expression, and "
"the result is a new collection. The syntax for projection is "
"`.![projectionExpression]`. For example, suppose we have a list of inventors "
"but want the list of cities where they were born.  Effectively, we want to "
"evaluate `placeOfBirth.city` for every entry in the inventor list. The "
"following example uses projection to do so:"

"Projection is supported for arrays and anything that implements "
"`java.lang.Iterable` or `java.util.Map`. When using a map to drive "
"projection, the projection expression is evaluated against each entry in the "
"map (represented as a Java `Map.Entry`). The result of a projection across a "
"map is a list that consists of the evaluation of the projection expression "
"against each map entry."
