"Container Configuration])  demonstrates how to provide a lot of the "

"`@Component`), AspectJ type expressions, or your own custom filter criteria "

"Spring provides further stereotype annotations: `@Component`, `@Service`, "
"and `@Controller`. `@Component` is a generic stereotype for any "
"Spring-managed component.  `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Controller` are "
"specializations of `@Component` for more specific use cases (in the "
"persistence, service, and presentation layers, respectively). Therefore, you "
"can annotate your component classes with `@Component`, but, by annotating "
"them with `@Repository`, `@Service`, or `@Controller` instead, your classes "
"are more properly suited for processing by tools or associating with "
"aspects. For example, these stereotype annotations make ideal targets for "
"pointcuts. `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Controller` may also carry "
"additional semantics in future releases of the Spring Framework. Thus, if "
"you are choosing between using `@Component` or `@Service` for your service "
"layer, `@Service` is clearly the better choice. Similarly, as stated "
"earlier, `@Repository` is already supported as a marker for automatic "
"exception translation in your persistence layer."
