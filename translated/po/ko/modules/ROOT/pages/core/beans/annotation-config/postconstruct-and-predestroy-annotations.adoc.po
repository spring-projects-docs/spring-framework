"The `CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` not only recognizes the `@Resource` "
"annotation but also the JSR-250 lifecycle annotations: "
"`jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` and "
"`jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy`. Introduced in Spring 2.5, the support for "
"these annotations offers an alternative to the lifecycle callback mechanism "
"described in "
"xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean[initialization "
"callbacks] and "
"xref:core/beans/factory-nature.adoc#beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean[destruction "
"callbacks]. Provided that the `CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` is "
"registered within the Spring `ApplicationContext`, a method carrying one of "
"these annotations is invoked at the same point in the lifecycle as the "
"corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or explicitly declared "
"callback method. In the following example, the cache is pre-populated upon "
"initialization and cleared upon destruction:"

"Like `@Resource`, the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotation types "
"were a part of the standard Java libraries from JDK 6 to 8. However, the "
"entire `javax.annotation` package got separated from the core Java modules "
"in JDK 9 and eventually removed in JDK 11. As of Jakarta EE 9, the package "

"artifact needs to be obtained via Maven Central now, simply to be added to "
"the application's classpath like any other library."
