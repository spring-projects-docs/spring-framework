"Spring's concept of a singleton bean differs from the singleton pattern as "

"hard-codes the scope of an object such that one and only one instance of a "
"particular class is created per ClassLoader. The scope of the Spring "

"that, if you define one bean for a particular class in a single Spring "
"container, the Spring container creates one and only one instance of the "
"class defined by that bean definition. The singleton scope is the default "
"scope in Spring. To define a bean as a singleton in XML, you can define a "
