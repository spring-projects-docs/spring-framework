"The `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` interface represents "

"You can then use `getBean` to retrieve instances of your beans. The "
"`ApplicationContext` interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, "
"but, ideally, your application code should never use them. Indeed, your "
"application code should have no calls to the `getBean()` method at all and "
"thus have no dependency on Spring APIs at all. For example, Spring's "
"integration with web frameworks provides dependency injection for various "
"web framework components such as controllers and JSF-managed beans, letting "
"you declare a dependency on a specific bean through metadata (such as an "
"autowiring annotation)."
