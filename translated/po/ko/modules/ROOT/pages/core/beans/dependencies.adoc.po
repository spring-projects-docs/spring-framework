"A typical enterprise application does not consist of a single object (or "
"bean in the Spring parlance). Even the simplest application has a few "
"objects that work together to present what the end-user sees as a coherent "
"application. This next section explains how you go from defining a number of "
"bean definitions that stand alone to a fully realized application where "
"objects collaborate to achieve a goal."
