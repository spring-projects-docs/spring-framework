"However, sometimes dependencies between beans are less direct. An example is "
"when a static initializer in a class needs to be triggered, such as for "
"database driver registration.  The `depends-on` attribute or `@DependsOn` "
"annotation can explicitly force one or more beans to be initialized before "
"the bean using this element is initialized. The following example uses the "
"`depends-on` attribute to express a dependency on a single bean:"
