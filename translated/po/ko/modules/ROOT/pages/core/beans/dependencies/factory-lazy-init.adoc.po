"By default, `ApplicationContext` implementations eagerly create and "
"configure all "
"xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-singleton[singleton] "
"beans as part of the initialization process. Generally, this "
"pre-instantiation is desirable, because errors in the configuration or "
"surrounding environment are discovered immediately, as opposed to hours or "
"even days later. When this behavior is not desirable, you can prevent "
"pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as "
"being lazy-initialized. A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to "
"create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup."
