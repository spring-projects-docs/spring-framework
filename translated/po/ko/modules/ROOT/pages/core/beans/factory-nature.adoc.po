"Autowiring is another alternative to obtain a reference to the "
"`ApplicationContext`. The _traditional_ `constructor` and `byType` "
"autowiring modes (as described in "
"xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.adoc[Autowiring "
"Collaborators]) can provide a dependency of type `ApplicationContext` for a "
"constructor argument or a setter method parameter, respectively. For more "
"flexibility, including the ability to autowire fields and multiple parameter "
"methods, use the annotation-based autowiring features. If you do, the "
"`ApplicationContext` is autowired into a field, constructor argument, or "
"method parameter that expects the `ApplicationContext` type if the field, "
"constructor, or method in question carries the `@Autowired` annotation. For "
"more information, see xref:core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.adoc[Using "
"`@Autowired`]."
