"Spring provides comprehensive support for annotation-based configuration, "
"operating on metadata in the component class itself by using annotations on "
"the relevant class, method, or field declaration. As mentioned in "
"xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-extension-bpp-examples-aabpp[Example: "
"The `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`], Spring uses "
"`BeanPostProcessors` in conjunction with annotations to make the core IOC "
"container aware of specific annotations."

"For example, the "
"xref:core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.adoc[`@Autowired`] annotation "
"provides the same capabilities as described in "
"xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.adoc[Autowiring Collaborators] "
"but with more fine-grained control and wider applicability. In addition, "
"Spring provides support for JSR-250 annotations, such as `@PostConstruct` "
"and `@PreDestroy`, as well as support for JSR-330 (Dependency Injection for "
"Java) annotations contained in the `jakarta.inject` package such as "
"`@Inject` and `@Named`. Details about those annotations can be found in the "
"xref:core/beans/standard-annotations.adoc[relevant section]."
