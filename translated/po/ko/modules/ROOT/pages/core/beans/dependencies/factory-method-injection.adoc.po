"In most application scenarios, most beans in the container are "
"xref:core/beans/factory-scopes.adoc#beans-factory-scopes-singleton[singletons]. "
"When a singleton bean needs to collaborate with another singleton bean or a "
"non-singleton bean needs to collaborate with another non-singleton bean, you "
"typically handle the dependency by defining one bean as a property of the "
"other. A problem arises when the bean lifecycles are different. Suppose "
"singleton bean A needs to use non-singleton (prototype) bean B, perhaps on "
"each method invocation on A. The container creates the singleton bean A only "
"once, and thus only gets one opportunity to set the properties. The "
"container cannot provide bean A with a new instance of bean B every time one "
"is needed."
