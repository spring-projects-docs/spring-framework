"Autowiring can update a configuration as your objects evolve. For example, "
"if you need to add a dependency to a class, that dependency can be satisfied "
"automatically without you needing to modify the configuration. Thus "
"autowiring can be especially useful during development, without negating the "
"option of switching to explicit wiring when the code base becomes more "
"stable."

"| (Default) No autowiring. Bean references must be defined by `ref` "
"elements. Changing\n"
"  the default setting is not recommended for larger deployments, because "
"specifying\n"
"  collaborators explicitly gives greater control and clarity. To some "
"extent, it\n"

"\n"
"| `byName`\n"
"| Autowiring by property name. Spring looks for a bean with the same name as "
"the\n"
"  property that needs to be autowired. For example, if a bean definition is "
"set to\n"
"  autowire by name and it contains a `master` property (that is, it has a\n"
"  `setMaster(..)` method), Spring looks for a bean definition named `master` "
"and uses\n"
"  it to set the property.\n"
"\n"
"| `byType`\n"
"| Lets a property be autowired if exactly one bean of the property type "
"exists in\n"
"  the container. If more than one exists, a fatal exception is thrown, which "
"indicates\n"
"  that you may not use `byType` autowiring for that bean. If there are no "
"matching\n"
"  beans, nothing happens (the property is not set).\n"
"\n"
"| `constructor`\n"
"| Analogous to `byType` but applies to constructor arguments. If there is "
"not exactly\n"
"  one bean of the constructor argument type in the container, a fatal error "
