"This chapter covers the Spring Framework implementation of the Inversion of "
"Control (IoC)  principle. Dependency injection (DI) is a specialized form of "
"IoC, whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects "
"they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory "
"method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is "
"constructed or returned from a factory method. The IoC container then "
"injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is "
"fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean "
"itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by "
"using direct construction of classes or a mechanism such as the Service "
"Locator pattern."

"In short, the `BeanFactory` provides the configuration framework and basic "

"In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that "
"are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an "
"object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC "
"container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your "
"application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the "
"configuration metadata used by a container."
