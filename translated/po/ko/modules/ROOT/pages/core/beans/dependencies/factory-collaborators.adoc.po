"Dependency injection (DI) is a process whereby objects define their "
"dependencies (that is, the other objects with which they work) only through "
"constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are "
"set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a "
"factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it "
"creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, "
"Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or "
"location of its dependencies on its own by using direct construction of "
"classes or the Service Locator pattern."

"Code is cleaner with the DI principle, and decoupling is more effective when "
"objects are provided with their dependencies. The object does not look up "

"when the dependencies are on interfaces or abstract base classes, which "
"allow for stub or mock implementations to be used in unit tests."
