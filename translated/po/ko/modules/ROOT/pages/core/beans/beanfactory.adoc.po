"The `BeanFactory` API provides the underlying basis for Spring's IoC "
"functionality.  Its specific contracts are mostly used in integration with "
"other parts of Spring and related third-party frameworks, and its "
"`DefaultListableBeanFactory` implementation is a key delegate within the "
"higher-level `GenericApplicationContext` container."

"`BeanFactory` and related interfaces (such as `BeanFactoryAware`, "
"`InitializingBean`, `DisposableBean`) are important integration points for "
"other framework components.  By not requiring any annotations or even "
"reflection, they allow for very efficient interaction between the container "
"and its components. Application-level beans may use the same callback "
"interfaces but typically prefer declarative dependency injection instead, "
"either through annotations or through programmatic configuration."

"Note that the core `BeanFactory` API level and its "
"`DefaultListableBeanFactory` implementation do not make assumptions about "
"the configuration format or any component annotations to be used. All of "
"these flavors come in through extensions (such as `XmlBeanDefinitionReader` "
"and `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`) and operate on shared "
"`BeanDefinition` objects as a core metadata representation.  This is the "
"essence of what makes Spring's container so flexible and extensible."

"Because an `ApplicationContext` includes all the functionality of a "

"`GenericApplicationContext` implementation), several kinds of beans are "
"detected by convention (that is, by bean name or by bean type -- in "
"particular, post-processors), while a plain `DefaultListableBeanFactory` is "

"`DefaultListableBeanFactory`, such post-processors do not get detected and "
"activated by default. This situation could be confusing, because nothing is "
"actually wrong with your bean configuration. Rather, in such a scenario, the "
"container needs to be fully bootstrapped through additional setup."
