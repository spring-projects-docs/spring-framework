"A bean definition can contain a lot of configuration information, including "
"constructor arguments, property values, and container-specific information, "
"such as the initialization method, a static factory method name, and so "
"on. A child bean definition inherits configuration data from a parent "
"definition. The child definition can override some values or add others as "
"needed. Using parent and child bean definitions can save a lot of "
"typing. Effectively, this is a form of templating."

"If you work with an `ApplicationContext` interface programmatically, child "
"bean definitions are represented by the `ChildBeanDefinition` class. Most "
"users do not work with them on this level. Instead, they configure bean "
"definitions declaratively in a class such as the "
"`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. When you use XML-based configuration "
"metadata, you can indicate a child bean definition by using the `parent` "
"attribute, specifying the parent bean as the value of this attribute. The "
"following example shows how to do so:"

"The parent bean cannot be instantiated on its own because it is incomplete, "
"and it is also explicitly marked as `abstract`. When a definition is "
"`abstract`, it is usable only as a pure template bean definition that serves "
"as a parent definition for child definitions. Trying to use such an "
"`abstract` parent bean on its own, by referring to it as a ref property of "
"another bean or doing an explicit `getBean()` call with the parent bean ID "
"returns an error. Similarly, the container's internal "
"`preInstantiateSingletons()` method ignores bean definitions that are "

"attribute to __true__, otherwise the application context will actually "
