"In common scenarios, `@Bean` methods are to be declared within "
"`@Configuration` classes, ensuring that full configuration class processing "

"When `@Bean` methods are declared within classes that are not annotated with "

"method mechanism without special runtime processing (that is, without "
"generating a CGLIB subclass for it).  A custom Java call to such a method "
"will not get intercepted by the container and therefore behaves just like a "
"regular method call, creating a new instance every time rather than reusing "
"an existing singleton (or scoped) instance for the given bean."

"As a consequence, `@Bean` methods on classes without runtime proxying are "
"not meant to declare inter-bean dependencies at all. Instead, they are "
"expected to operate on their containing component's fields and, optionally, "
"on arguments that a factory method may declare in order to receive autowired "
"collaborators. Such a `@Bean` method therefore never needs to invoke other "
"`@Bean` methods; every such call can be expressed through a factory method "
"argument instead. The positive side-effect here is that no CGLIB subclassing "
"has to be applied at runtime, reducing the overhead and the footprint."
