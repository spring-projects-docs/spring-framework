"Historically, the value of placeholders in elements could be resolved only "
"against JVM system properties or environment variables. This is no longer "
"the case. Because the `Environment` abstraction is integrated throughout the "
"container, it is easy to route resolution of placeholders through it. This "
"means that you may configure the resolution process in any way you like. You "
"can change the precedence of searching through system properties and "
"environment variables or remove them entirely. You can also add your own "
"property sources to the mix, as appropriate."
