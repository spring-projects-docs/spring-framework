"Once configured for the `ApplicationContext`, any bean within that "
"`ApplicationContext` may implement `LoadTimeWeaverAware`, thereby receiving "
"a reference to the load-time weaver instance. This is particularly useful in "
"combination with xref:data-access/orm/jpa.adoc[Spring's JPA support] where "
"load-time weaving may be necessary for JPA class transformation.  Consult "

"{spring-framework-api}/orm/jpa/LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean.html[`LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean`] "
