"There are pros and cons for considering validation as business logic, and "
"Spring offers a design for validation and data binding that does not exclude "
"either one of them.  Specifically, validation should not be tied to the web "
"tier and should be easy to localize, and it should be possible to plug in "
"any available validator. Considering these concerns, Spring provides a "
"`Validator` contract that is both basic and eminently usable in every layer "
"of an application."

"Data binding is useful for letting user input be dynamically bound to the "
"domain model of an application (or whatever objects you use to process user "
"input). Spring provides the aptly named `DataBinder` to do exactly that. The "
"`Validator` and the `DataBinder` make up the `validation` package, which is "
"primarily used in but not limited to the web layer."

"The `BeanWrapper` is a fundamental concept in the Spring Framework and is "
"used in a lot of places. However, you probably do not need to use the "
"`BeanWrapper` directly. Because this is reference documentation, however, we "
"feel that some explanation might be in order. We explain the `BeanWrapper` "
"in this chapter, since, if you are going to use it at all, you are most "
"likely do so when trying to bind data to objects."

"Spring's `DataBinder` and the lower-level `BeanWrapper` both use "
"`PropertyEditorSupport` implementations to parse and format property "
"values. The `PropertyEditor` and `PropertyEditorSupport` types are part of "
"the JavaBeans specification and are also explained in this chapter. Spring's "
"`core.convert` package provides a general type conversion facility, as well "
"as a higher-level `format` package for formatting UI field values. You can "
"use these packages as simpler alternatives to `PropertyEditorSupport` "
"implementations. They are also discussed in this chapter."

"Spring supports Java Bean Validation through setup infrastructure and an "
"adaptor to Spring's own `Validator` contract. Applications can enable Bean "
"Validation once globally, as described in "
"xref:core/validation/beanvalidation.adoc[Java Bean Validation], and use it "
"exclusively for all validation needs. In the web layer, applications can "
"further register controller-local Spring `Validator` instances per "
"`DataBinder`, as described in "
"xref:core/validation/beanvalidation.adoc#validation-binder[Configuring a "
"`DataBinder`], which can be useful for plugging in custom validation logic."
