"Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-oriented Programming "
"(OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program structure. The key "
"unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of "
"modularity is the aspect. Aspects enable the modularization of concerns "
"(such as transaction management) that cut across multiple types and "
"objects. (Such concerns are often termed \"crosscutting\" concerns in AOP "
"literature.)"

"One of the key components of Spring is the AOP framework. While the Spring "
"IoC container does not depend on AOP (meaning you do not need to use AOP if "
"you don't want to), AOP complements Spring IoC to provide a very capable "
"middleware solution."
