"The Spring Expression Language (\"SpEL\" for short) is a powerful expression "
"language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at "
"runtime. The language syntax is similar to the "
"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/[Jakarta Expression "
"Language] but offers additional features, most notably method invocation and "
"basic string templating functionality."

"While there are several other Java expression languages available -- OGNL, "
"MVEL, and JBoss EL, to name a few -- the Spring Expression Language was "
"created to provide the Spring community with a single well supported "
"expression language that can be used across all the products in the Spring "
"portfolio. Its language features are driven by the requirements of the "
"projects in the Spring portfolio, including tooling requirements for code "
"completion within the {spring-site-tools}[Spring Tools] IDE support. That "
"said, SpEL is based on a technology-agnostic API that lets other expression "
"language implementations be integrated, should the need arise."

"While SpEL serves as the foundation for expression evaluation within the "
"Spring portfolio, it is not directly tied to Spring and can be used "
"independently. To be self contained, many of the examples in this chapter "
"use SpEL as if it were an independent expression language. This requires "
"creating a few bootstrapping infrastructure classes, such as the "
"parser. Most Spring users need not deal with this infrastructure and can, "
"instead, author only expression strings for evaluation.  An example of this "
"typical use is the integration of SpEL into creating XML or annotation-based "
"bean definitions, as shown in xref:core/expressions/beandef.adoc[Expression "
"support for defining bean definitions]."

"used as the target objects for expression evaluation. These class "
