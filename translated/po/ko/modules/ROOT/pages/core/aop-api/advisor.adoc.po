"Apart from the special case of introductions, any advisor can be used with "
"any advice.  `org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor` is the "
"most commonly used advisor class. It can be used with a `MethodInterceptor`, "
"`BeforeAdvice`, or `ThrowsAdvice`."

"It is possible to mix advisor and advice types in Spring in the same AOP "
"proxy. For example, you could use an interception around advice, throws "
"advice, and before advice in one proxy configuration. Spring automatically "
"creates the necessary interceptor chain."
