"Note that in the parent bean example, we explicitly marked the parent bean "
"definition as being abstract by setting the `abstract` attribute to `true`, "
"as described xref:core/beans/child-bean-definitions.adoc[previously], so "
"that it may not actually ever be instantiated. Application contexts (but not "
"simple bean factories), by default, pre-instantiate all "
"singletons. Therefore, it is important (at least for singleton beans)  that, "
"if you have a (parent) bean definition that you intend to use only as a "
"template, and this definition specifies a class, you must make sure to set "
"the `abstract` attribute to `true`. Otherwise, the application context "
"actually tries to pre-instantiate it."
