"Spring makes it easy to create Java enterprise applications. It provides "
"everything you need to embrace the Java language in an enterprise "
"environment, with support for Groovy and Kotlin as alternative languages on "
"the JVM, and with the flexibility to create many kinds of architectures "
"depending on an application's needs. As of Spring Framework 6.0, Spring "
"requires Java 17+."

"Spring supports a wide range of application scenarios. In a large "
"enterprise, applications often exist for a long time and have to run on a "
"JDK and application server whose upgrade cycle is beyond the developer's "
"control. Others may run as a single jar with the server embedded, possibly "
"in a cloud environment. Yet others may be standalone applications (such as "
"batch or integration workloads) that do not need a server."

"The term \"Spring\" means different things in different contexts. It can be "
"used to refer to the Spring Framework project itself, which is where it all "
"started. Over time, other Spring projects have been built on top of the "
"Spring Framework. Most often, when people say \"Spring\", they mean the "
"entire family of projects. This reference documentation focuses on the "
"foundation: the Spring Framework itself."

"The Spring Framework is divided into modules. Applications can choose which "
"modules they need.  At the heart are the modules of the core container, "
"including a configuration model and a dependency injection mechanism. Beyond "
"that, the Spring Framework provides foundational support for different "
"application architectures, including messaging, transactional data and "
"persistence, and web. It also includes the Servlet-based Spring MVC web "
"framework and, in parallel, the Spring WebFlux reactive web framework."

"A note about modules: Spring Framework's jars allow for deployment to the "
"module path (Java Module System). For use in module-enabled applications, "
"the Spring Framework jars come with `Automatic-Module-Name` manifest entries "
"which define stable language-level module names (`spring.core`, "
"`spring.context`, etc.) independent from jar artifact names. The jars follow "
"the same naming pattern with `-` instead of `.` – for example, `spring-core` "
"and `spring-context`.  Of course, Spring Framework's jars also work fine on "
"the classpath."

"Jakarta EE to be in competition with Spring, they are in fact "
