"The Data Access Object (DAO) support in Spring is aimed at making it easy to "
"work with data access technologies (such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JPA) in a "
"consistent way. This lets you switch between the aforementioned persistence "
"technologies fairly easily, and it also lets you code without worrying about "
"catching exceptions that are specific to each technology."

"Spring provides a convenient translation from technology-specific "
"exceptions, such as `SQLException` to its own exception class hierarchy, "
"which has `DataAccessException` as the root exception. These exceptions wrap "
"the original exception so that there is never any risk that you might lose "
"any information about what might have gone wrong."

"In addition to JDBC exceptions, Spring can also wrap JPA- and "
"Hibernate-specific exceptions, converting them to a set of focused runtime "
"exceptions. This lets you handle most non-recoverable persistence exceptions "
"in only the appropriate layers, without having annoying boilerplate "
"catch-and-throw blocks and exception declarations in your DAOs.  (You can "
"still trap and handle exceptions anywhere you need to though.) As mentioned "
"above, JDBC exceptions (including database-specific dialects) are also "
"converted to the same hierarchy, meaning that you can perform some "
"operations with JDBC within a consistent programming model."

"The preceding discussion holds true for the various template classes in "
"Spring's support for various ORM frameworks. If you use the "
"interceptor-based classes, the application must care about handling "
"`HibernateExceptions` and `PersistenceExceptions` itself, preferably by "
"delegating to the `convertHibernateAccessException(..)` or "
"`convertJpaAccessException(..)` methods, respectively, of "
"`SessionFactoryUtils`. These methods convert the exceptions to exceptions "
"that are compatible with the exceptions in the `org.springframework.dao` "
"exception hierarchy. As `PersistenceExceptions` are unchecked, they can get "
"thrown, too (sacrificing generic DAO abstraction in terms of exceptions, "
"though)."
