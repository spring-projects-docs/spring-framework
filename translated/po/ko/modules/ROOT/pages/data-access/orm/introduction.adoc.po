"The Spring Framework supports integration with the Java Persistence API "
"(JPA) and supports native Hibernate for resource management, data access "
"object (DAO) implementations, and transaction strategies. For example, for "
"Hibernate, there is first-class support with several convenient IoC features "
"that address many typical Hibernate integration issues.  You can configure "
"all of the supported features for OR (object relational) mapping tools "
"through Dependency Injection. They can participate in Spring's resource and "
"transaction management, and they comply with Spring's generic transaction "
"and DAO exception hierarchies. The recommended integration style is to code "
"DAOs against plain Hibernate or JPA APIs."

"Spring adds significant enhancements to the ORM layer of your choice when "
"you create data access applications. You can leverage as much of the "
"integration support as you wish, and you should compare this integration "
"effort with the cost and risk of building a similar infrastructure "
"in-house. You can use much of the ORM support as you would a library, "
"regardless of technology, because everything is designed as a set of "
"reusable JavaBeans. ORM in a Spring IoC container facilitates configuration "
"and deployment. Thus, most examples in this section show configuration "
"inside a Spring container."

"*Common data access exceptions.* Spring can wrap exceptions from your ORM "

"common runtime\n"
"`DataAccessException` hierarchy. This feature lets you handle most "
"persistence\n"
"exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the appropriate layers, "
"without\n"
"annoying boilerplate catches, throws, and exception declarations. You can "
"still trap\n"
"and handle exceptions as necessary. Remember that JDBC exceptions "
"(including\n"
"DB-specific dialects) are also converted to the same hierarchy, meaning that "
"you can\n"
"perform some operations with JDBC within a consistent programming model.\n"

"*General resource management.* Spring application contexts can handle the "
"location\n"
"and configuration of Hibernate `SessionFactory` instances, JPA "
"`EntityManagerFactory`\n"
"instances, JDBC `DataSource` instances, and other related resources. This "
"makes these\n"
"values easy to manage and change. Spring offers efficient, easy, and safe "
"handling of\n"
"persistence resources. For example, related code that uses Hibernate "
"generally needs to\n"
"use the same Hibernate `Session` to ensure efficiency and proper transaction "
"handling.\n"
"Spring makes it easy to create and bind a `Session` to the current thread "
"transparently,\n"
"by exposing a current `Session` through the Hibernate "
"`SessionFactory`. Thus, Spring\n"
"solves many chronic problems of typical Hibernate usage, for any local or "
"JTA\n"
"transaction environment.\n"

"the\n"
"`@Transactional` annotation or by explicitly configuring the transaction AOP "
"advice in\n"
"an XML configuration file. In both cases, transaction semantics and "
"exception handling\n"
"(rollback and so on) are handled for you. As discussed in\n"
"xref:data-access/orm/general.adoc#orm-resource-mngmnt[Resource and "
"Transaction Management],\n"
"you can also swap various transaction managers, without affecting your "
"ORM-related code.\n"
"For example, you can swap between local transactions and JTA, with the same "
"full services\n"
"(such as declarative transactions) available in both "
"scenarios. Additionally,\n"
"JDBC-related code can fully integrate transactionally with the code you use "
"to do ORM.\n"
"This is useful for data access that is not suitable for ORM (such as batch "
"processing and\n"
"BLOB streaming) but that still needs to share common transactions with ORM "
"operations.\n"
