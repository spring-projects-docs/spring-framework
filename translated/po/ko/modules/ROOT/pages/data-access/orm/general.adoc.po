"The major goal of Spring's ORM integration is clear application layering "
"(with any data access and transaction technology) and for loose coupling of "
"application objects -- no more business service dependencies on the data "
"access or transaction strategy, no more hard-coded resource lookups, no more "
"hard-to-replace singletons, no more custom service registries. The goal is "
"to have one simple and consistent approach to wiring up application objects, "
"keeping them as reusable and free from container dependencies as "
"possible. All the individual data access features are usable on their own "
"but integrate nicely with Spring's application context concept, providing "
"XML-based configuration and cross-referencing of plain JavaBean instances "
"that need not be Spring-aware. In a typical Spring application, many "
"important objects are JavaBeans: data access templates, data access objects, "
"transaction managers, business services that use the data access objects and "
"transaction managers, web view resolvers, web controllers that use the "
"business services, and so on."

"Typical business applications are cluttered with repetitive resource "
"management code.  Many projects try to invent their own solutions, sometimes "
"sacrificing proper handling of failures for programming convenience. Spring "
"advocates simple solutions for proper resource handling, namely IoC through "
"templating in the case of JDBC and applying AOP interceptors for the ORM "
"technologies."

"The infrastructure provides proper resource handling and appropriate "
"conversion of specific API exceptions to an unchecked infrastructure "
"exception hierarchy. Spring introduces a DAO exception hierarchy, applicable "
"to any data access strategy. For direct JDBC, the `JdbcTemplate` class "
"mentioned in a xref:data-access/jdbc/core.adoc#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[previous "
"section] provides connection handling and proper conversion of "
"`SQLException` to the `DataAccessException` hierarchy, including translation "
"of database-specific SQL error codes to meaningful exception classes. For "
"ORM technologies, see the "
"xref:data-access/orm/general.adoc#orm-exception-translation[next section] "

"When you use Hibernate or JPA in a DAO, you must decide how to handle the "
"persistence technology's native exception classes. The DAO throws a subclass "
"of a `HibernateException` or `PersistenceException`, depending on the "
"technology. These exceptions are all runtime exceptions and do not have to "
"be declared or caught. You may also have to deal with "
"`IllegalArgumentException` and `IllegalStateException`. This means that "
"callers can only treat exceptions as being generally fatal, unless they want "
"to depend on the persistence technology's own exception structure. Catching "
"specific causes (such as an optimistic locking failure) is not possible "
"without tying the caller to the implementation strategy.  This trade-off "
"might be acceptable to applications that are strongly ORM-based or do not "
"need any special exception treatment (or both). However, Spring lets "
"exception translation be applied transparently through the `@Repository` "
"annotation. The following examples (one for Java configuration and one for "
"XML configuration) show how to do so:"
