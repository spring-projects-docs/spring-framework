"`core`: The `org.springframework.jdbc.core` package contains the "
"`JdbcTemplate` class and its various callback interfaces, plus a variety of "
"related classes. A subpackage named `org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple` "
"contains the `SimpleJdbcInsert` and `SimpleJdbcCall` classes. Another "
"subpackage named `org.springframework.jdbc.core.namedparam` contains the "
"`NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` class and the related support classes. See "

"`datasource`: The `org.springframework.jdbc.datasource` package contains a "
"utility class for easy `DataSource` access and various simple `DataSource` "
"implementations that you can use for testing and running unmodified JDBC "
"code outside of a Jakarta EE container. A subpackage named "
"`org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.embedded` provides support for creating "
"embedded databases by using Java database engines, such as HSQL, H2, and "
"Derby. See xref:data-access/jdbc/connections.adoc[Controlling Database "
"Connections] and "

"`object`: The `org.springframework.jdbc.object` package contains classes "
"that represent RDBMS queries, updates, and stored procedures as thread-safe, "
"reusable objects. See xref:data-access/jdbc/object.adoc[Modeling JDBC "
"Operations as Java Objects]. This style results in a more object-oriented "
"approach, although objects returned by queries are naturally disconnected "
"from the database. This higher-level of JDBC abstraction depends on the "
"lower-level abstraction in the `org.springframework.jdbc.core` package."

"`support`: The `org.springframework.jdbc.support` package provides "
"`SQLException` translation functionality and some utility "
"classes. Exceptions thrown during JDBC processing are translated to "
"exceptions defined in the `org.springframework.dao` package. This means that "
"code using the Spring JDBC abstraction layer does not need to implement JDBC "
"or RDBMS-specific error handling. All translated exceptions are unchecked, "
"which gives you the option of catching the exceptions from which you can "
"recover while letting other exceptions be propagated to the caller. See "
"xref:data-access/jdbc/core.adoc#jdbc-SQLExceptionTranslator[Using "
"`SQLExceptionTranslator`]."
