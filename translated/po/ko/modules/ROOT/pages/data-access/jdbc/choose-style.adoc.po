"You can choose among several approaches to form the basis for your JDBC "
"database access.  In addition to three flavors of `JdbcTemplate`, a "
"`SimpleJdbcInsert` and `SimpleJdbcCall` approach optimizes database "
"metadata, and the RDBMS Object style results in a more object-oriented "
"approach. Once you start using one of these approaches, you can still mix "
"and match to include a feature from a different approach."

"`JdbcTemplate` is the classic and most popular Spring JDBC approach. This "

"`NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` wraps a `JdbcTemplate` to provide named "
"parameters instead of the traditional JDBC `?` placeholders. This approach "
"provides better documentation and ease of use when you have multiple "

"`SimpleJdbcInsert` and `SimpleJdbcCall` optimize database metadata to limit "
"the amount of necessary configuration. This approach simplifies coding so "
"that you only need to provide the name of the table or procedure and a map "
"of parameters matching the column names. This works only if the database "
"provides adequate metadata. If the database does not provide this metadata, "
"you have to provide explicit configuration of the parameters."

"RDBMS objects — including `MappingSqlQuery`, `SqlUpdate`, and "
"`StoredProcedure` — require you to create reusable and thread-safe objects "
"during initialization of your data-access layer. This approach allows you to "
"define your query string, declare parameters, and compile the query. Once "
"you do that, `execute(...)`, `update(...)`, and `findObject(...)` methods "
"can be called multiple times with various parameter values."
