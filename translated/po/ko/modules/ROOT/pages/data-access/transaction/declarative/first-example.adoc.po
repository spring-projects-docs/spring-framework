"Consider the following interface and its attendant implementation. This "
"example uses `Foo` and `Bar` classes as placeholders so that you can "
"concentrate on the transaction usage without focusing on a particular domain "
"model. For the purposes of this example, the fact that the "
"`DefaultFooService` class throws `UnsupportedOperationException` instances "
"in the body of each implemented method is good. That behavior lets you see "
"transactions being created and then rolled back in response to the "
"`UnsupportedOperationException` instance. The following listing shows the "
"`FooService` interface:"
