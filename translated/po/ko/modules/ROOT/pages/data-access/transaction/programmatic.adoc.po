"In Reactive Streams, a `Subscriber` can cancel its `Subscription` and stop "
"its `Publisher`. Operators in Project Reactor, as well as in other "
"libraries, such as `next()`, `take(long)`, `timeout(Duration)`, and others "
"can issue cancellations. There is no way to know the reason for the "
"cancellation, whether it is due to an error or a simply lack of interest to "
"consume further. Since version 5.3 cancel signals lead to a roll back.  As a "
"result it is important to consider the operators used downstream from a "
"transaction `Publisher`. In particular in the case of a `Flux` or other "
"multi-value `Publisher`, the full output must be consumed to allow the "
"transaction to complete."
