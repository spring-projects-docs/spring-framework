"Programmatic transaction management is usually a good idea only if you have "
"a small number of transactional operations. For example, if you have a web "
"application that requires transactions only for certain update operations, "
"you may not want to set up transactional proxies by using Spring or any "
"other technology. In this case, using the `TransactionTemplate` may be a "
"good approach. Being able to set the transaction name explicitly is also "
"something that can be done only by using the programmatic approach to "
"transaction management."

"On the other hand, if your application has numerous transactional "
"operations, declarative transaction management is usually worthwhile. It "
"keeps transaction management out of business logic and is not difficult to "
"configure. When using the Spring Framework, rather than EJB CMT, the "
"configuration cost of declarative transaction management is greatly reduced."
