"It is not sufficient merely to tell you to annotate your classes with the "
"`@Transactional` annotation, add `@EnableTransactionManagement` to your "

"The most important concepts to grasp with regard to the Spring Framework's "
"declarative transaction support are that this support is enabled "
"xref:core/aop/proxying.adoc#aop-understanding-aop-proxies[via AOP proxies] "
"and that the transactional advice is driven by metadata (currently XML- or "
"annotation-based). The combination of AOP with transactional metadata yields "
"an AOP proxy that uses a `TransactionInterceptor` in conjunction with an "
"appropriate `TransactionManager` implementation to drive transactions around "
"method invocations."

"Spring Framework's `TransactionInterceptor` provides transaction management "
"for imperative and reactive programming models. The interceptor detects the "
"desired flavor of transaction management by inspecting the method return "
"type. Methods returning a reactive type such as `Publisher` or Kotlin `Flow` "
"(or a subtype of those) qualify for reactive transaction management. All "
"other return types including `void` use the code path for imperative "
"transaction management."
