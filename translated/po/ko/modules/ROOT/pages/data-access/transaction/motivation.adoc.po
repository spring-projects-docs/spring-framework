"Global transactions let you work with multiple transactional resources, "
"typically relational databases and message queues. The application server "
"manages global transactions through the JTA, which is a cumbersome API "
"(partly due to its exception model). Furthermore, a JTA `UserTransaction` "
"normally needs to be sourced from JNDI, meaning that you also need to use "
"JNDI in order to use JTA. The use of global transactions limits any "
"potential reuse of application code, as JTA is normally only available in an "
"application server environment."

"Previously, the preferred way to use global transactions was through EJB CMT "
"(Container Managed Transaction). CMT is a form of declarative transaction "
"management (as distinguished from programmatic transaction management). EJB "
"CMT removes the need for transaction-related JNDI lookups, although the use "
"of EJB itself necessitates the use of JNDI. It removes most but not all of "
"the need to write Java code to control transactions. The significant "
"downside is that CMT is tied to JTA and an application server "
"environment. Also, it is only available if one chooses to implement business "
"logic in EJBs (or at least behind a transactional EJB facade). The negatives "
"of EJB in general are so great that this is not an attractive proposition, "
"especially in the face of compelling alternatives for declarative "
"transaction management."

"Local transactions are resource-specific, such as a transaction associated "
"with a JDBC connection. Local transactions may be easier to use but have a "
"significant disadvantage: They cannot work across multiple transactional "
"resources. For example, code that manages transactions by using a JDBC "
"connection cannot run within a global JTA transaction. Because the "
"application server is not involved in transaction management, it cannot help "
"ensure correctness across multiple resources. (It is worth noting that most "
"applications use a single transaction resource.) Another downside is that "
"local transactions are invasive to the programming model."

"Spring resolves the disadvantages of global and local transactions. It lets "
"application developers use a consistent programming model in any "
"environment.  You write your code once, and it can benefit from different "
"transaction management strategies in different environments. The Spring "
"Framework provides both declarative and programmatic transaction "
"management. Most users prefer declarative transaction management, which we "
"recommend in most cases."

"With programmatic transaction management, developers work with the Spring "
"Framework transaction abstraction, which can run over any underlying "
"transaction infrastructure.  With the preferred declarative model, "
"developers typically write little or no code related to transaction "
"management and, hence, do not depend on the Spring Framework transaction API "
"or any other transaction API."
