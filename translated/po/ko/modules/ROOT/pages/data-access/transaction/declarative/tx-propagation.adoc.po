"`PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` enforces a physical transaction, either locally for "
"the current scope if no transaction exists yet or participating in an "
"existing 'outer' transaction defined for a larger scope. This is a fine "
"default in common call stack arrangements within the same thread (for "
"example, a service facade that delegates to several repository methods where "
"all the underlying resources have to participate in the service-level "
"transaction)."

"`validateExistingTransactions` flag to `true` on your transaction manager if "
"you want isolation level declarations to be rejected when participating in "
"an existing transaction with a different isolation level. This non-lenient "
"mode also rejects read-only mismatches (that is, an inner read-write "

"When the propagation setting is `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`, a logical "
"transaction scope is created for each method upon which the setting is "
"applied. Each such logical transaction scope can determine rollback-only "
"status individually, with an outer transaction scope being logically "
"independent from the inner transaction scope.  In the case of standard "
"`PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` behavior, all these scopes are mapped to the same "
"physical transaction. So a rollback-only marker set in the inner transaction "
"scope does affect the outer transaction's chance to actually commit."

"However, in the case where an inner transaction scope sets the rollback-only "
"marker, the outer transaction has not decided on the rollback itself, so the "
"rollback (silently triggered by the inner transaction scope) is "
"unexpected. A corresponding `UnexpectedRollbackException` is thrown at that "
"point. This is expected behavior so that the caller of a transaction can "
"never be misled to assume that a commit was performed when it really was "
"not. So, if an inner transaction (of which the outer caller is not aware) "
"silently marks a transaction as rollback-only, the outer caller still calls "
"commit. The outer caller needs to receive an `UnexpectedRollbackException` "
"to indicate clearly that a rollback was performed instead."

"hence, can commit or roll back independently, with an outer transaction not "
"affected by an inner transaction's rollback status and with an inner "
