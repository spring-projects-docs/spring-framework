"As of Spring 4.2, the listener of an event can be bound to a phase of the "
"transaction.  The typical example is to handle the event when the "
"transaction has completed successfully.  Doing so lets events be used with "
"more flexibility when the outcome of the current transaction actually "
"matters to the listener."

"You can register a regular event listener by using the `@EventListener` "
"annotation.  If you need to bind it to the transaction, use "
"`@TransactionalEventListener`.  When you do so, the listener is bound to the "
"commit phase of the transaction by default."

"The next example shows this concept. Assume that a component publishes an "
"order-created event and that we want to define a listener that should only "
"handle that event once the transaction in which it has been published has "
"committed successfully. The following example sets up such an event "
"listener:"

"The `@TransactionalEventListener` annotation exposes a `phase` attribute "
"that lets you customize the phase of the transaction to which the listener "
"should be bound.  The valid phases are `BEFORE_COMMIT`, `AFTER_COMMIT` "
"(default), `AFTER_ROLLBACK`, as well as `AFTER_COMPLETION` which aggregates "
"the transaction completion (be it a commit or a rollback)."

"As of 6.1, `@TransactionalEventListener` can work with thread-bound "
"transactions managed by `PlatformTransactionManager` as well as reactive "
"transactions managed by `ReactiveTransactionManager`.  For the former, "
"listeners are guaranteed to see the current thread-bound transaction.  Since "
"the latter uses the Reactor context instead of thread-local variables, the "
"transaction context needs to be included in the published event instance as "
"the event source.  See the "
"{spring-framework-api}/transaction/reactive/TransactionalEventPublisher.html[`TransactionalEventPublisher`] "
"javadoc for details."
