"The key to the Spring transaction abstraction is the notion of a transaction "
"strategy. A transaction strategy is defined by a `TransactionManager`, "

"`org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager` interface for "
"imperative transaction management and the "
"`org.springframework.transaction.ReactiveTransactionManager` interface for "
