"Spring's transaction abstraction is generally application "
"server-agnostic. Additionally, Spring's `JtaTransactionManager` class (which "
"can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA `UserTransaction` and "
"`TransactionManager` objects) autodetects the location for the latter "
"object, which varies by application server. Having access to the JTA "
"`TransactionManager` allows for enhanced transaction semantics -- in "
"particular, supporting transaction suspension. See the "
"{spring-framework-api}/transaction/jta/JtaTransactionManager.html[`JtaTransactionManager`] "
"javadoc for details."

"Spring's `JtaTransactionManager` is the standard choice to run on Jakarta EE "
"application servers and is known to work on all common servers. Advanced "
"functionality, such as transaction suspension, works on many servers as well "
"(including GlassFish, JBoss and Geronimo) without any special configuration "
"required."
