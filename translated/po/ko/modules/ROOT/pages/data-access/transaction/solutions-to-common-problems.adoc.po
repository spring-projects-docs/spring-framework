"Use the correct `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation based on your "
"choice of transactional technologies and requirements. Used properly, the "
"Spring Framework merely provides a straightforward and portable "
"abstraction. If you use global transactions, you must use the "
"`org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager` class (or an "
"xref:data-access/transaction/application-server-integration.adoc[application "
"server-specific subclass] of it) for all your transactional "
"operations. Otherwise, the transaction infrastructure tries to perform local "
"transactions on such resources as container `DataSource` instances. Such "
"local transactions do not make sense, and a good application server treats "
"them as errors."
