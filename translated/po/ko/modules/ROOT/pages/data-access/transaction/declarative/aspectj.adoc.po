"You can also use the Spring Framework's `@Transactional` support outside of "
"a Spring container by means of an AspectJ aspect. To do so, first annotate "
"your classes (and optionally your classes' methods) with the "
"`@Transactional` annotation, and then link (weave) your application with the "
"`org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect` "
"defined in the `spring-aspects.jar` file. You must also configure the aspect "
"with a transaction manager. You can use the Spring Framework's IoC container "
"to take care of dependency-injecting the aspect. The simplest way to "
"configure the transaction management aspect is to use the "
"`<tx:annotation-driven/>` element and specify the `mode` attribute to "
"`aspectj` as described in "
"xref:data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.adoc[Using "
"`@Transactional`].  Because we focus here on applications that run outside "
"of a Spring container, we show you how to do it programmatically."
