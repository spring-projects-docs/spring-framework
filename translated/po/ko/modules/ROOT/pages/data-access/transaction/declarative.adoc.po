"Most Spring Framework users choose declarative transaction management. This "
"option has the least impact on application code and, hence, is most "
"consistent with the ideals of a non-invasive lightweight container."

"The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is made possible "
"with Spring aspect-oriented programming (AOP). However, as the transactional "
"aspects code comes with the Spring Framework distribution and may be used in "
"a boilerplate fashion, AOP concepts do not generally have to be understood "
"to make effective use of this code."

"The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is similar to EJB "
"CMT, in that you can specify transaction behavior (or lack of it) down to "
"the individual method level.  You can make a `setRollbackOnly()` call within "
"a transaction context, if necessary. The differences between the two types "
"of transaction management are:"

"Unlike EJB CMT, which is tied to JTA, the Spring Framework's declarative "
"transaction management works in any environment. It can work with JTA "
"transactions or local transactions by using JDBC, JPA, or Hibernate by "
"adjusting the configuration files."

"The Spring Framework lets you customize transactional behavior by using "
"AOP.  For example, you can insert custom behavior in the case of transaction "
"rollback. You can also add arbitrary advice, along with transactional "
"advice. With EJB CMT, you cannot influence the container's transaction "
"management, except with `setRollbackOnly()`."

"The Spring Framework does not support propagation of transaction contexts "
"across remote calls, as high-end application servers do. If you need this "
"feature, we recommend that you use EJB. However, consider carefully before "
"using such a feature, because, normally, one does not want transactions to "
"span remote calls."

"The concept of rollback rules is important. They let you specify which "
"exceptions (and throwables) should cause automatic rollback. You can specify "
"this declaratively, in configuration, not in Java code. So, although you can "
"still call `setRollbackOnly()` on the `TransactionStatus` object to roll "
"back the current transaction back, most often you can specify a rule that "
"`MyApplicationException` must always result in rollback. The significant "
"advantage to this option is that business objects do not depend on the "
"transaction infrastructure. For example, they typically do not need to "
"import Spring transaction APIs or other Spring APIs."

"Although EJB container default behavior automatically rolls back the "
"transaction on a system exception (usually a runtime exception), EJB CMT "
"does not roll back the transaction automatically on an application exception "
"(that is, a checked exception other than `java.rmi.RemoteException`). While "
"the Spring default behavior for declarative transaction management follows "
"EJB convention (roll back is automatic only on unchecked exceptions), it is "
"often useful to customize this behavior."
