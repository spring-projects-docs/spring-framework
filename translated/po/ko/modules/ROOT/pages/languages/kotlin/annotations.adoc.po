"The Spring Framework also takes advantage of "
"{kotlin-docs}/null-safety.html[Kotlin null-safety] to determine if an HTTP "
"parameter is required without having to explicitly define the `required` "
"attribute. That means `@RequestParam name: String?` is treated as not "
"required and, conversely, `@RequestParam name: String` is treated as being "
"required.  This feature is also supported on the Spring Messaging `@Header` "
"annotation."
