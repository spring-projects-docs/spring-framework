"Keep in mind that Kotlin extensions need to be imported to be used. This "
"means, for example, that the `GenericApplicationContext.registerBean` Kotlin "
"extension is available only if "
"`org.springframework.context.support.registerBean` is imported.  That said, "
"similar to static imports, an IDE should automatically suggest the import in "
"most cases."
