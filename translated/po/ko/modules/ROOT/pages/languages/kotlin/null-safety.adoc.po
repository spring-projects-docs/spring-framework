"One of Kotlin's key features is {kotlin-docs}/null-safety.html[null-safety], "
"which cleanly deals with `null` values at compile time rather than bumping "
"into the famous `NullPointerException` at runtime. This makes applications "
"safer through nullability declarations and expressing \"`value or no "
"value`\" semantics without paying the cost of wrappers, such as `Optional`.  "
"Kotlin allows using functional constructs with nullable values. See this "
"{baeldung-blog}/kotlin-null-safety[comprehensive guide to Kotlin "
"null-safety]."
