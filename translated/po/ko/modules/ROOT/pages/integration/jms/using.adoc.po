"interface. `DynamicDestinationResolver` is the default implementation used "

"destinations, and are often not registered in JNDI. The API used to create "
"dynamic destinations varies from provider to provider since the properties "
"associated with the destination are vendor-specific.  However, a simple "
"implementation choice that is sometimes made by vendors is to disregard the "
"warnings in the JMS specification and to use the method `TopicSession` "
"`createTopic(String topicName)` or the `QueueSession` `createQueue(String "
"queueName)` method to create a new destination with default destination "
"properties. Depending on the vendor implementation, "
"`DynamicDestinationResolver` can then also create a physical destination "
