"\n"
"| `destination-type`\n"
"| The JMS destination type for this listener: `queue`, `topic`, "
"`durableTopic`, `sharedTopic`,\n"
"  or `sharedDurableTopic`. This potentially enables the `pubSubDomain`, "
"`subscriptionDurable`\n"
"  and `subscriptionShared` properties of the container. The default is "
"`queue` (which disables\n"

"\n"
"| `response-destination-type`\n"
"| The JMS destination type for responses: `queue` or `topic`. The default is "

"| `client-id`\n"
"| The JMS client ID for this listener container. You must specify it when "

"  durable subscriptions.\n"
"\n"
"| `cache`\n"
"| The cache level for JMS resources: `none`, `connection`, `session`, "
"`consumer`, or\n"
"  `auto`. By default (`auto`), the cache level is effectively `consumer`, "
"unless\n"
"  an external transaction manager has been specified -- in which case, the "

"  ConnectionFactory is an XA-aware pool).\n"

"`transacted`. A value\n"

"\n"
"| `transaction-manager`\n"
"| A reference to an external `PlatformTransactionManager` (typically an "
"XA-based\n"
"  transaction coordinator, such as Spring's `JtaTransactionManager`). If not "
"specified,\n"
"  native acknowledging is used (see the `acknowledge` attribute).\n"

"  a simple number indicating the maximum number (for example, `5`) or a "
"range indicating the\n"
"  lower as well as the upper limit (for example, `3-5`). Note that a "
"specified minimum is just a\n"
"  hint and might be ignored at runtime. The default is `1`. You should keep "
"concurrency limited to `1` in\n"
"  case of a topic listener or if queue ordering is important. Consider "
"raising it for\n"
"  general queues.\n"
"\n"
"| `prefetch`\n"
"| The maximum number of messages to load into a single session. Note that "
"raising this\n"
"  number might lead to starvation of concurrent consumers.\n"
"\n"
"| `receive-timeout`\n"
"| The timeout (in milliseconds) to use for receive calls. The default is "
"`1000` (one\n"
"  second). `-1` indicates no timeout.\n"
"\n"
"| `back-off`\n"
"| Specifies the `BackOff` instance to use to compute the interval between "
"recovery\n"
"  attempts. If the `BackOffExecution` implementation returns "
"`BackOffExecution#STOP`,\n"
"  the listener container does not further try to recover. The "
"`recovery-interval`\n"
"  value is ignored when this property is set. The default is a "
"`FixedBackOff` with\n"
"  an interval of 5000 milliseconds (that is, five seconds).\n"
"\n"
"| `recovery-interval`\n"
"| Specifies the interval between recovery attempts, in milliseconds. It "
"offers a convenient\n"
"  way to create a `FixedBackOff` with the specified interval. For more "
"recovery\n"
"  options, consider specifying a `BackOff` instance instead. The default is "
"5000 milliseconds\n"
"  (that is, five seconds).\n"
"\n"
"| `phase`\n"
"| The lifecycle phase within which this container should start and stop. The "
"lower the\n"
"  value, the earlier this container starts and the later it stops. The "
"default is\n"
"  `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, meaning that the container starts as late as possible "
"and stops as\n"
"  soon as possible.\n"
