"While JMS is typically associated with asynchronous processing, you can "
"consume messages synchronously. The `receive(..)` methods on `JmsTemplate` "
"and `JmsClient` provide this functionality. During a synchronous receive, "
"the calling thread blocks until a message becomes available. This can be a "
"dangerous operation, since the calling thread can potentially be blocked "
"indefinitely. The `receiveTimeout` property specifies how long the receiver "
"should wait before giving up waiting for a message."
