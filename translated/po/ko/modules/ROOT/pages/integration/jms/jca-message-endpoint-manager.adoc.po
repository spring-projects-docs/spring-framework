"Beginning with version 2.5, Spring also provides support for a JCA-based "
"`MessageListener` container. The `JmsMessageEndpointManager` tries to "
"automatically determine the `ActivationSpec` class name from the provider's "
"`ResourceAdapter` class name. Therefore, it is typically possible to provide "
"Spring's generic `JmsActivationSpecConfig`, as the following example shows:"

"Alternatively, you can set up a `JmsMessageEndpointManager` with a given "
"`ActivationSpec` object. The `ActivationSpec` object may also come from a "
"JNDI lookup (using `<jee:jndi-lookup>`). The following example shows how to "
"do so:"

"Spring also provides a generic JCA message endpoint manager that is not tied "
"to JMS: "
"`org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointManager`. This "
"component allows for using any message listener type (such as a JMS "
"`MessageListener`) and any provider-specific `ActivationSpec` object. See "
"your JCA provider's documentation to find out about the actual capabilities "
"of your connector, and see the "
"{spring-framework-api}/jca/endpoint/GenericMessageEndpointManager.html[`GenericMessageEndpointManager`] "

"JCA-based message endpoint management is very analogous to EJB 2.1 "
"Message-Driven Beans.  It uses the same underlying resource provider "
"contract. As with EJB 2.1 MDBs, you can use any message listener interface "
"supported by your JCA provider in the Spring context as well.  Spring "
"nevertheless provides explicit \"`convenience`\" support for JMS, because "
"JMS is the most common endpoint API used with the JCA endpoint management "
"contract."
