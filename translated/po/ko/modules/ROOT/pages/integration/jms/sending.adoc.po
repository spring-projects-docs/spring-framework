"To facilitate the sending of domain model objects, the `JmsTemplate` has "
"various send methods that take a Java object as an argument for a message's "
"data content. The overloaded methods `convertAndSend()` and "
"`receiveAndConvert()` methods in `JmsTemplate` delegate the conversion "
"process to an instance of the `MessageConverter` interface. This interface "
"defines a simple contract to convert between Java objects and JMS "
"messages. The default implementation (`SimpleMessageConverter`) supports "
"conversion between `String` and `TextMessage`, `byte[]` and `BytesMessage`, "
"and `java.util.Map` and `MapMessage`. By using the converter, you and your "
"application code can focus on the business object that is being sent or "
"received through JMS and not be concerned with the details of how it is "
"represented as a JMS message."

"The sandbox currently includes a `MapMessageConverter`, which uses "
"reflection to convert between a JavaBean and a `MapMessage`. Other popular "
"implementation choices you might implement yourself are converters that use "

"`TextMessage` that represents the object."
