"Since version 4.1, Spring's caching abstraction fully supports the JCache "
"standard (JSR-107) annotations: `@CacheResult`, `@CachePut`, `@CacheRemove`, "
"and `@CacheRemoveAll` as well as the `@CacheDefaults`, `@CacheKey`, and "
"`@CacheValue` companions.  You can use these annotations even without "
"migrating your cache store to JSR-107.  The internal implementation uses "
"Spring's caching abstraction and provides default `CacheResolver` and "
"`KeyGenerator` implementations that are compliant with the specification. In "
"other words, if you are already using Spring's caching abstraction, you can "
"switch to these standard annotations without changing your cache storage (or "
"configuration, for that matter)."

"| Spring | JSR-107 | Remark\n"
"\n"
"| `@Cacheable`\n"
"| `@CacheResult`\n"
"| Fairly similar. `@CacheResult` can cache specific exceptions and force "
"the\n"
"  execution of the method regardless of the content of the cache.\n"
"\n"
"| `@CachePut`\n"
"| `@CachePut`\n"
"| While Spring updates the cache with the result of the method invocation, "
"JCache\n"
"  requires that it be passed it as an argument that is annotated with "
"`@CacheValue`.\n"
"  Due to this difference, JCache allows updating the cache before or after "
"the\n"
"  actual method invocation.\n"
"\n"
"| `@CacheEvict`\n"
"| `@CacheRemove`\n"
"| Fairly similar. `@CacheRemove` supports conditional eviction when the\n"
"  method invocation results in an exception.\n"

"JCache has the notion of `javax.cache.annotation.CacheResolver`, which is "

"supports only a single cache. By default, a simple implementation retrieves "
"the cache to use based on the name declared on the annotation. It should be "
