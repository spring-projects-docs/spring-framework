"If annotations are not an option (perhaps due to having no access to the "
"sources or no external code), you can use XML for declarative caching. So, "
"instead of annotating the methods for caching, you can specify the target "
"method and the caching directives externally (similar to the declarative "
"transaction management "
"xref:data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.adoc[advice]). The "
"example from the previous section can be translated into the following "
"example:"

"In the preceding configuration, the `bookService` is made cacheable. The "
"caching semantics to apply are encapsulated in the `cache:advice` "
"definition, which causes the `findBooks` method to be used for putting data "
"into the cache and the `loadBooks` method for evicting data. Both "
"definitions work against the `books` cache."

"The `aop:config` definition applies the cache advice to the appropriate "
"points in the program by using the AspectJ pointcut expression (more "
"information is available in xref:core/aop.adoc[Aspect Oriented Programming "
"with Spring]). In the preceding example, all methods from the `BookService` "
"are considered and the cache advice is applied to them."

"The declarative XML caching supports all of the annotation-based model, so "
"moving between the two should be fairly easy. Furthermore, both can be used "
"inside the same application.  The XML-based approach does not touch the "
"target code. However, it is inherently more verbose. When dealing with "
"classes that have overloaded methods that are targeted for caching, "
"identifying the proper methods does take an extra effort, since the `method` "
"argument is not a good discriminator. In these cases, you can use the "
"AspectJ pointcut to cherry pick the target methods and apply the appropriate "
"caching functionality.  However, through XML, it is easier to apply package "
"or group or interface-wide caching (again, due to the AspectJ pointcut) and "
"to create template-like definitions (as we did in the preceding example by "
"defining the target cache through the `cache:definitions` `cache` "
"attribute)."
