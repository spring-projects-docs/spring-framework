"The caching abstraction lets you use your own annotations to identify what "
"method triggers cache population or eviction. This is quite handy as a "
"template mechanism, as it eliminates the need to duplicate cache annotation "
"declarations, which is especially useful if the key or condition are "
"specified or if the foreign imports (`org.springframework`) are not allowed "
"in your code base. Similarly to the rest of the "
"xref:core/beans/classpath-scanning.adoc#beans-stereotype-annotations[stereotype] "
"annotations, you can use `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, `@CacheEvict`, and "
"`@CacheConfig` as "
"xref:core/beans/classpath-scanning.adoc#beans-meta-annotations[meta-annotations] "
"(that is, annotations that can annotate other annotations). In the following "
"example, we replace a common `@Cacheable` declaration with our own custom "
