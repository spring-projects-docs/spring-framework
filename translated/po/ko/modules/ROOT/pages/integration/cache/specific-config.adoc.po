"Directly through your cache provider. The cache abstraction is an "
"abstraction, not a cache implementation. The solution you use might support "
"various data policies and different topologies that other solutions do not "
"support (for example, the JDK `ConcurrentHashMap` -- exposing that in the "
"cache abstraction would be useless because there would no backing "
"support). Such functionality should be controlled directly through the "
"backing cache (when configuring it) or through its native API."
