"Clearly, there are plenty of caching products out there that you can use as "
"a backing store. For those that do not support JSR-107 you need to provide a "
"`CacheManager` and a `Cache` implementation. This may sound harder than it "
"is, since, in practice, the classes tend to be simple "
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern[adapters] that map the caching "
"abstraction framework on top of the storage API, as the _Caffeine_ classes "
"do.  Most `CacheManager` classes can use the classes in the "
"`org.springframework.cache.support` package (such as `AbstractCacheManager` "
"which takes care of the boiler-plate code, leaving only the actual mapping "
"to be completed)."
