"always tries the queue before creating a new thread beyond the core size, a "

"Consider the case, as mentioned above, when a task is rejected. By default, "
"when a task is rejected, a thread pool executor throws a "
"`TaskRejectedException`. However, the rejection policy is actually "
"configurable. The exception is thrown when using the default rejection "
"policy, which is the `AbortPolicy` implementation.  For applications where "
"some tasks can be skipped under heavy load, you can instead configure either "
"`DiscardPolicy` or `DiscardOldestPolicy`. Another option that works well for "
"applications that need to throttle the submitted tasks under heavy load is "
"the `CallerRunsPolicy`. Instead of throwing an exception or discarding "
"tasks, that policy forces the thread that is calling the submit method to "
"run the task itself.  The idea is that such a caller is busy while running "
"that task and not able to submit other tasks immediately. Therefore, it "
"provides a simple way to throttle the incoming load while maintaining the "
"limits of the thread pool and queue. Typically, this allows the executor to "
"\"`catch up`\" on the tasks it is handling and thereby frees up some "
"capacity on the queue, in the pool, or both. You can choose any of these "
"options from an enumeration of values available for the `rejection-policy` "
"attribute on the `executor` element."
