"The ahead-of-time cache is a JVM feature introduced in Java 24 via "
"https://openjdk.org/jeps/483[JEP 483] that can help reduce the startup time "
"and memory footprint of Java applications. AOT cache is a natural evolution "
"of "
"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/vm/class-data-sharing.html[Class "
"Data Sharing (CDS)].  Spring Framework supports both CDS and AOT cache, and "
"it is recommended that you use the latter if available in the JVM version "
"you are using (Java 24+)."

"To use this feature, an AOT cache should be created for the particular "
"classpath of the application. It is possible to create this cache on the "
"deployed instance, or during a training run performed for example when "
"packaging the application thanks to a hook-point provided by the Spring "
"Framework to ease such use case. Once the cache is available, users should "
"opt in to use it via a JVM flag."
