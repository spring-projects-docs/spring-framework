"JMS can be roughly divided into two areas of functionality, namely the "
"production and consumption of messages. The `JmsTemplate` class is used for "
"message production and synchronous message receipt. For asynchronous receipt "
"similar to Jakarta EE's message-driven bean style, Spring provides a number "
"of message-listener containers that you can use to create Message-Driven "
"POJOs (MDPs). Spring also provides a declarative way to create message "
"listeners."

"The `org.springframework.jms.core` package provides the core functionality "
"for using JMS. It contains JMS template classes that simplify the use of the "
"JMS by handling the creation and release of resources, much like the "
"`JdbcTemplate` does for JDBC. The design principle common to Spring template "
"classes is to provide helper methods to perform common operations and, for "
"more sophisticated usage, delegate the essence of the processing task to "
"user-implemented callback interfaces. The JMS template follows the same "
"design. The classes offer various convenience methods for sending messages, "
"consuming messages synchronously, and exposing the JMS session and message "
"producer to the user."

"The `org.springframework.jms.support` package provides `JMSException` "
"translation functionality. The translation converts the checked "
"`JMSException` hierarchy to a mirrored hierarchy of unchecked exceptions. If "
"any provider-specific subclasses of the checked `jakarta.jms.JMSException` "
"exist, this exception is wrapped in the unchecked "
"`UncategorizedJmsException`."

"Finally, the `org.springframework.jms.connection` package provides an "
"implementation of the `ConnectionFactory` suitable for use in standalone "

"`PlatformTransactionManager` for JMS (the cunningly named "
"`JmsTransactionManager`). This allows for seamless integration of JMS as a "
"transactional resource into Spring's transaction management mechanisms."
