"A checkpoint can be created on demand, for example using a command like "
"`jcmd application.jar JDK.checkpoint`. Before the creation of the "
"checkpoint, Spring stops all the running beans, giving them a chance to "
"close resources if needed by implementing `Lifecycle.stop`. After restore, "
"the same beans are restarted, with `Lifecycle.start` allowing beans to "
"reopen resources when relevant. For libraries that do not depend on Spring, "
"custom checkpoint/restore integration can be provided by implementing "
"`org.crac.Resource` and registering the related instance."
