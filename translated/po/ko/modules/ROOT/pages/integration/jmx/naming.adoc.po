"Behind the scenes, the `MBeanExporter` delegates to an implementation of the "
"`ObjectNamingStrategy` to obtain an `ObjectName` instance for each of the "
"beans it registers.  By default, the default implementation, "
"`KeyNamingStrategy` uses the key of the `beans` `Map` as the "
"`ObjectName`. In addition, the `KeyNamingStrategy` can map the key of the "
"`beans` `Map` to an entry in a `Properties` file (or files) to resolve the "
"`ObjectName`. In addition to the `KeyNamingStrategy`, Spring provides two "
"additional `ObjectNamingStrategy` implementations: the "
"`IdentityNamingStrategy` (which builds an `ObjectName` based on the JVM "
"identity of the bean) and the `MetadataNamingStrategy` (which uses "
"source-level metadata to obtain the `ObjectName`)."
