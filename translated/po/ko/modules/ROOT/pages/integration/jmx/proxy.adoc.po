"Spring JMX lets you create proxies that re-route calls to MBeans that are "
"registered in a local or remote `MBeanServer`. These proxies provide you "
"with a standard Java interface, through which you can interact with your "
"MBeans. The following code shows how to configure a proxy for an MBean "
"running in a local `MBeanServer`:"
