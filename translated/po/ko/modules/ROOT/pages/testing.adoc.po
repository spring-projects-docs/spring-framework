"This chapter covers Spring's support for integration testing and best "
"practices for unit testing. The Spring team advocates test-driven "
"development (TDD). The Spring team has found that the correct use of "
"inversion of control (IoC) certainly does make both unit and integration "
"testing easier (in that the presence of setter methods and appropriate "
"constructors on classes makes them easier to wire together in a test without "
"having to set up service locator registries and similar structures)."
