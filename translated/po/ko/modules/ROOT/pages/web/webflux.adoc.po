"The original web framework included in the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC, "
"was purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers. The "
"reactive-stack web framework, Spring WebFlux, was added later in version "
"5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports {reactive-streams-site}/[Reactive "
"Streams] back pressure, and runs on such servers as Netty, and Servlet "
"containers."

"Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules "
"({spring-framework-code}/spring-webmvc[spring-webmvc] and "
"{spring-framework-code}/spring-webflux[spring-webflux]) and co-exist side by "
"side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional. Applications can use "
"one or the other module or, in some cases, both -- for example, Spring MVC "
"controllers with the reactive `WebClient`."
