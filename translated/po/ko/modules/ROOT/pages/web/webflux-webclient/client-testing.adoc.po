"To test code that uses the `WebClient`, you can use a mock web server, such "
"as https://github.com/square/okhttp#mockwebserver[OkHttp MockWebServer] or "
"https://wiremock.org/[WireMock]. Mock web servers accept requests over HTTP "
"like a regular server, and that means you can test with the same HTTP client "
"that is also configured in the same way as in production, which is important "
"because there are often subtle differences in the way different clients "
"handle network I/O. Another advantage of mock web servers is the ability to "
"simulate specific network issues and conditions at the transport level, in "
"combination with the client used in production."
