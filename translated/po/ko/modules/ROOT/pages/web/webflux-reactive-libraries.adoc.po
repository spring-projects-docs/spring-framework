"`spring-webflux` depends on `reactor-core` and uses it internally to compose "
"asynchronous logic and to provide Reactive Streams support. Generally, "
"WebFlux APIs return `Flux` or `Mono` (since those are used internally) and "
"leniently accept any Reactive Streams `Publisher` implementation as input.  "
"When a `Publisher` is provided, it can be treated only as a stream with "
"unknown semantics (0..N).  If, however, the semantics are known, you should "
"wrap it with `Flux` or `Mono.from(Publisher)` instead of passing the raw "
"`Publisher`.  The use of `Flux` versus `Mono` is important, because it helps "
"to express cardinality -- for example, whether a single or multiple "
"asynchronous values are expected, and that can be essential for making "
"decisions (for example, when encoding or decoding HTTP messages)."

"For annotated controllers, WebFlux transparently adapts to the reactive "
"library chosen by the application. This is done with the help of the "
"{spring-framework-api}/core/ReactiveAdapterRegistry.html[`ReactiveAdapterRegistry`], "
"which provides pluggable support for reactive library and other asynchronous "
"types. The registry has built-in support for RxJava 3, Kotlin coroutines and "
"SmallRye Mutiny, but you can register others, too."
