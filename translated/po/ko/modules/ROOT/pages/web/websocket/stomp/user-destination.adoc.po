"An application can send messages that target a specific user, and Spring's "
"STOMP support recognizes destinations prefixed with `/user/` for this "
"purpose.  For example, a client might subscribe to the "
"`/user/queue/position-updates` destination.  `UserDestinationMessageHandler` "
"handles this destination and transforms it into a destination unique to the "
"user session (such as `/queue/position-updates-user123`).  This provides the "
"convenience of subscribing to a generically named destination while, at the "
"same time, ensuring no collisions with other users who subscribe to the same "
"destination so that each user can receive unique stock position updates."

"When working with user destinations, it is important to configure broker and "

"xref:web/websocket/stomp/enable.adoc[Enable STOMP], or otherwise the broker "
"would handle \"/user\" prefixed messages that should only be handled by "
"`UserDestinationMessageHandler`."

"On the sending side, messages can be sent to a destination such as "
"pass:q[`/user/{username}/queue/position-updates`], which in turn is "
"translated by the `UserDestinationMessageHandler` into one or more "

"component within the application send messages that target a specific user "
"without necessarily knowing anything more than their name and the generic "
"destination. This is also supported through an annotation and a messaging "
"template."

"When you use user destinations with an external message broker, you should "

"when the user session is over, all unique user queues are removed. For "
"example, RabbitMQ creates auto-delete queues when you use destinations such "
"as `/exchange/amq.direct/position-updates`.  So, in that case, the client "
"could subscribe to `/user/exchange/amq.direct/position-updates`.  Similarly, "
