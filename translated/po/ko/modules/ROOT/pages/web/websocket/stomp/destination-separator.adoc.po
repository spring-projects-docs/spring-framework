"When messages are routed to `@MessageMapping` methods, they are matched with "
"`AntPathMatcher`. By default, patterns are expected to use slash (`/`) as "
"the separator.  This is a good convention in web applications and similar to "
"HTTP URLs. However, if you are more used to messaging conventions, you can "
"switch to using dot (`.`) as the separator."

"In the preceding example, we did not change the prefixes on the \"`broker "
