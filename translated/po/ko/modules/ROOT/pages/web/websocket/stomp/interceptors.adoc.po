"xref:web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.adoc[Events] provide "
"notifications for the lifecycle of a STOMP connection but not for every "
"client message. Applications can also register a `ChannelInterceptor` to "
"intercept any message and in any part of the processing chain.  The "
"following example shows how to intercept inbound messages from clients:"

"A custom `ChannelInterceptor` can use `StompHeaderAccessor` or "

"Applications can also implement `ExecutorChannelInterceptor`, which is a "
"sub-interface of `ChannelInterceptor` with callbacks in the thread in which "
"the messages are handled.  While a `ChannelInterceptor` is invoked once for "
"each message sent to a channel, the `ExecutorChannelInterceptor` provides "
"hooks in the thread of each `MessageHandler` subscribed to messages from the "
"channel."

"Note that, as with the `SessionDisconnectEvent` described earlier, a "
"DISCONNECT message can be from the client or it can also be automatically "
"generated when the WebSocket session is closed. In some cases, an "
"interceptor may intercept this message more than once for each "
"session. Components should be idempotent with regard to multiple disconnect "
"events."
