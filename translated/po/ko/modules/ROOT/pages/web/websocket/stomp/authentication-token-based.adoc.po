"{spring-github-org}/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth] provides "
"support for token based security, including JSON Web Token (JWT).  You can "
"use this as the authentication mechanism in Web applications, including "
"STOMP over WebSocket interactions, as described in the previous section "
"(that is, to maintain identity through a cookie-based session)."

"The {rfc-site}/rfc6455#section-10.5[WebSocket protocol, RFC 6455] \"doesn't "
"prescribe any particular way that servers can authenticate clients during "
"the WebSocket handshake.\" In practice, however, browser clients can use "
"only standard authentication headers (that is, basic HTTP authentication) or "
"cookies and cannot (for example)  provide custom headers. Likewise, the "
"SockJS JavaScript client does not provide a way to send HTTP headers with "
"SockJS transport requests. See {sockjs-client}/issues/196[sockjs-client "
"issue 196].  Instead, it does allow sending query parameters that you can "
"use to send a token, but that has its own drawbacks (for example, the token "
"may be inadvertently logged with the URL in server logs)."

"Therefore, applications that wish to avoid the use of cookies may not have "
"any good alternatives for authentication at the HTTP protocol level. Instead "
"of using cookies, they may prefer to authenticate with headers at the STOMP "
"messaging protocol level.  Doing so requires two simple steps:"

"The next example uses server-side configuration to register a custom "

"authenticate and set the user header on the CONNECT `Message`. Spring notes "

"Also, note that, when you use Spring Security's authorization for messages, "
"at present, you need to ensure that the authentication `ChannelInterceptor` "
"config is ordered ahead of Spring Security's. This is best done by declaring "
"the custom interceptor in its own implementation of "
"`WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` that is marked with "
"`@Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 99)`."
