"The simple broker is great for getting started but supports only a subset of "
"STOMP commands (it does not support acks, receipts, and some other "
"features), relies on a simple message-sending loop, and is not suitable for "
"clustering.  As an alternative, you can upgrade your applications to use a "
"full-featured message broker."

"See the STOMP documentation for your message broker of choice (such as "
"https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html[RabbitMQ], "
"https://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html[ActiveMQ], and others), install the "
"broker, and run it with STOMP support enabled. Then you can enable the STOMP "
"broker relay (instead of the simple broker) in the Spring configuration."

"The STOMP broker relay in the preceding configuration is a Spring "
"{spring-framework-api}/messaging/MessageHandler.html[`MessageHandler`] that "
"handles messages by forwarding them to an external message broker.  To do "
"so, it establishes TCP connections to the broker, forwards all messages to "
"it, and then forwards all messages received from the broker to clients "
"through their WebSocket sessions. Essentially, it acts as a \"`relay`\" that "
"forwards messages in both directions."
