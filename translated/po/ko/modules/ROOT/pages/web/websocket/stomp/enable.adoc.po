"have any special meaning. They are merely a convention to differentiate "
"between pub-sub versus point-to-point messaging (that is, many subscribers "
"versus one consumer). When you use an external broker, check the STOMP page "
"of the broker to understand what kind of STOMP destinations and prefixes it "
"supports."
