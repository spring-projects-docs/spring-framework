"A STOMP broker relay maintains a single \"`system`\" TCP connection to the "
"broker.  This connection is used for messages originating from the "
"server-side application only, not for receiving messages. You can configure "
"the STOMP credentials (that is, the STOMP frame `login` and `passcode` "
"headers) for this connection. This is exposed in both the XML namespace and "
"Java configuration as the `systemLogin` and `systemPasscode` properties with "
"default values of `guest` and `guest`."

"The STOMP broker relay also creates a separate TCP connection for every "
"connected WebSocket client. You can configure the STOMP credentials that are "
"used for all TCP connections created on behalf of clients. This is exposed "
"in both the XML namespace and Java configuration as the `clientLogin` and "
"`clientPasscode` properties with default values of `guest` and `guest`."

"The STOMP broker relay always sets the `login` and `passcode` headers on "
"every `CONNECT` frame that it forwards to the broker on behalf of "
"clients. Therefore, WebSocket clients need not set those headers. They are "
"ignored. As the xref:web/websocket/stomp/authentication.adoc[Authentication] "
"section explains, WebSocket clients should instead rely on HTTP "
"authentication to protect the WebSocket endpoint and establish the client "
"identity."

"The STOMP broker relay also sends and receives heartbeats to and from the "
"message broker over the \"`system`\" TCP connection. You can configure the "
"intervals for sending and receiving heartbeats (10 seconds each by "
"default). If connectivity to the broker is lost, the broker relay continues "
"to try to reconnect, every 5 seconds, until it succeeds."

"Any Spring bean can implement `ApplicationListener<BrokerAvailabilityEvent>` "
"to receive notifications when the \"`system`\" connection to the broker is "
"lost and re-established. For example, a Stock Quote service that broadcasts "
"stock quotes can stop trying to send messages when there is no active "
"\"`system`\" connection."

"By default, the STOMP broker relay always connects, and reconnects as needed "
"if connectivity is lost, to the same host and port. If you wish to supply "
"multiple addresses, on each attempt to connect, you can configure a supplier "
"of addresses, instead of a fixed host and port. The following example shows "
"how to do that:"

"You can also configure the STOMP broker relay with a `virtualHost` "
"property.  The value of this property is set as the `host` header of every "
"`CONNECT` frame and can be useful (for example, in a cloud environment where "
"the actual host to which the TCP connection is established differs from the "
"host that provides the cloud-based STOMP service)."
