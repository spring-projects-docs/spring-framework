"Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) was originally created for scripting "
"languages (such as Ruby, Python, and Perl) to connect to enterprise message "
"brokers. It is designed to address a minimal subset of commonly used "
"messaging patterns. STOMP can be used over any reliable two-way streaming "
"network protocol, such as TCP and WebSocket.  Although STOMP is a "
"text-oriented protocol, message payloads can be either text or binary."

"Clients can use the `SEND` or `SUBSCRIBE` commands to send or subscribe for "
"messages, along with a `destination` header that describes what the message "
"is about and who should receive it. This enables a simple publish-subscribe "
"mechanism that you can use to send messages through the broker to other "
"connected clients or to send messages to the server to request that some "
"work be performed."

"When you use Spring's STOMP support, the Spring WebSocket application acts "
"as the STOMP broker to clients. Messages are routed to `@Controller` "
"message-handling methods or to a simple in-memory broker that keeps track of "
"subscriptions and broadcasts messages to subscribed users. You can also "
"configure Spring to work with a dedicated STOMP broker (such as RabbitMQ, "
"ActiveMQ, and others) for the actual broadcasting of messages. In that case, "
"Spring maintains TCP connections to the broker, relays messages to it, and "
"passes messages from it down to connected WebSocket clients. Thus, Spring "
"web applications can rely on unified HTTP-based security, common validation, "
"and a familiar programming model for message handling."
