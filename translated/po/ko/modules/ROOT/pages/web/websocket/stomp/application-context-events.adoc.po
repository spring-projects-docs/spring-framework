"`BrokerAvailabilityEvent`: Indicates when the broker becomes available or "
"unavailable.  While the \"`simple`\" broker becomes available immediately on "
"startup and remains so while the application is running, the STOMP \"`broker "
"relay`\" can lose its connection to the full featured broker (for example, "
"if the broker is restarted). The broker relay has reconnect logic and "
"re-establishes the \"`system`\" connection to the broker when it comes "
"back. As a result, this event is published whenever the state changes from "
"connected to disconnected and vice-versa. Components that use the "
"`SimpMessagingTemplate` should subscribe to this event and avoid sending "
"messages at times when the broker is not available. In any case, they should "
"be prepared to handle `MessageDeliveryException` when sending a message."

"`SessionConnectEvent`: Published when a new STOMP CONNECT is received to "
"indicate the start of a new client session. The event contains the message "
"that represents the connect, including the session ID, user information (if "
"any), and any custom headers the client sent. This is useful for tracking "
"client sessions. Components subscribed to this event can wrap the contained "
"message with `SimpMessageHeaderAccessor` or `StompMessageHeaderAccessor`."

"When you use a full-featured broker, the STOMP \"`broker relay`\" "
"automatically reconnects the \"`system`\" connection if broker becomes "
"temporarily unavailable. Client connections, however, are not automatically "
"reconnected. Assuming heartbeats are enabled, the client typically notices "
"the broker is not responding within 10 seconds. Clients need to implement "
"their own reconnecting logic."
