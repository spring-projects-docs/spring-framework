"The WebSocket protocol defines two types of messages (text and binary), but "
"their content is undefined. The protocol defines a mechanism for client and "
"server to negotiate a sub-protocol (that is, a higher-level messaging "
"protocol) to use on top of WebSocket to define what kind of messages each "
"can send, what the format is, the content of each message, and so on. The "
"use of a sub-protocol is optional but, either way, the client and the server "
"need to agree on some protocol that defines message content."
