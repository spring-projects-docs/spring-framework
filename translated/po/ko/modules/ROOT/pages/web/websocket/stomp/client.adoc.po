"The STOMP protocol also supports receipts, where the client must add a "
"`receipt` header to which the server responds with a RECEIPT frame after the "
"send or subscribe are processed. To support this, the `StompSession` offers "
"`setAutoReceipt(boolean)` that causes a `receipt` header to be added on "
"every subsequent send or subscribe event.  Alternatively, you can also "
"manually add a receipt header to the `StompHeaders`.  Both send and "
"subscribe return an instance of `Receiptable` that you can use to register "
"for receipt success and failure callbacks.  For this feature, you must "
"configure the client with a `TaskScheduler` and the amount of time before a "
"receipt expires (15 seconds by default)."
