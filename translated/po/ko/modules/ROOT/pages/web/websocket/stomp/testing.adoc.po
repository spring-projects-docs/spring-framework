"There are two main approaches to testing applications when you use Spring's "
"STOMP-over-WebSocket support. The first is to write server-side tests to "
"verify the functionality of controllers and their annotated message-handling "
"methods. The second is to write full end-to-end tests that involve running a "
"client and a server."

"The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, each has a "
"place in an overall test strategy. Server-side tests are more focused and "
"easier to write and maintain. End-to-end integration tests, on the other "
"hand, are more complete and test much more, but they are also more involved "
"to write and maintain."

"The simplest form of server-side tests is to write controller unit "
"tests. However, this is not useful enough, since much of what a controller "
"does depends on its annotations. Pure unit tests simply cannot test that."

"Ideally, controllers under test should be invoked as they are at runtime, "
"much like the approach to testing controllers that handle HTTP requests by "
"using the Spring MVC Test framework -- that is, without running a Servlet "
"container but relying on the Spring Framework to invoke the annotated "
"controllers. As with Spring MVC Test, you have two possible alternatives "
"here, either use a \"`context-based`\" or use a \"`standalone`\" setup:"

"The second approach is to create end-to-end integration tests. For that, you "
"need to run a WebSocket server in embedded mode and connect to it as a "
"WebSocket client that sends WebSocket messages containing STOMP frames.  The "
"https://github.com/rstoyanchev/spring-websocket-portfolio/tree/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/portfolio/web[tests "
"for the stock portfolio] sample application also demonstrate this approach "
"by using Tomcat as the embedded WebSocket server and a simple STOMP client "
"for test purposes."
