"Every STOMP over WebSocket messaging session begins with an HTTP request.  "
"That can be a request to upgrade to WebSockets (that is, a WebSocket "
"handshake)  or, in the case of SockJS fallbacks, a series of SockJS HTTP "
"transport requests."

"Many web applications already have authentication and authorization in place "
"to secure HTTP requests. Typically, a user is authenticated through Spring "
"Security by using some mechanism such as a login page, HTTP basic "
"authentication, or another way.  The security context for the authenticated "
"user is saved in the HTTP session and is associated with subsequent requests "
"in the same cookie-based session."

"Therefore, for a WebSocket handshake or for SockJS HTTP transport requests, "
"typically, there is already an authenticated user accessible through "
"`HttpServletRequest#getUserPrincipal()`. Spring automatically associates "
"that user with a WebSocket or SockJS session created for them and, "
"subsequently, with all STOMP messages transported over that session through "
"a user header."

"In short, a typical web application needs to do nothing beyond what it "
"already does for security. The user is authenticated at the HTTP request "
"level with a security context that is maintained through a cookie-based HTTP "
"session (which is then associated with WebSocket or SockJS sessions created "
"for that user) and results in a user header being stamped on every `Message` "
"flowing through the application."

"The STOMP protocol does have `login` and `passcode` headers on the `CONNECT` "
"frame.  Those were originally designed for and are needed for STOMP over "
"TCP. However, for STOMP over WebSocket, by default, Spring ignores "
"authentication headers at the STOMP protocol level, and assumes that the "
"user is already authenticated at the HTTP transport level.  The expectation "
"is that the WebSocket or SockJS session contain the authenticated user."
