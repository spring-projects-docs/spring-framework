"The Spring Frameworks lets you define an HTTP service as a Java interface "
"with HTTP exchange methods. You can then generate a proxy that implements "
"this interface and performs the exchanges. This helps to simplify HTTP "
"remote access and provides additional flexibility in choosing an API style "
"such as synchronous or reactive."
