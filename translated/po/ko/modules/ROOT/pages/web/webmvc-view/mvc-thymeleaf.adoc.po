"Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine that emphasizes "
"natural HTML templates that can be previewed in a browser by "
"double-clicking, which is very helpful for independent work on UI templates "
"(for example, by a designer) without the need for a running server. If you "
"want to replace JSPs, Thymeleaf offers one of the most extensive sets of "
"features to make such a transition easier. Thymeleaf is actively developed "
"and maintained. For a more complete introduction, see the "
"https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] project home page."

"The Thymeleaf integration with Spring MVC is managed by the Thymeleaf "
"project.  The configuration involves a few bean declarations, such as "
"`ServletContextTemplateResolver`, `SpringTemplateEngine`, and "
"`ThymeleafViewResolver`.  See "
"https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html[Thymeleaf+Spring] for more "
