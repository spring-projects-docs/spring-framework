"The `JacksonJsonView` uses the Jackson library's `JsonMapper` to render the "
"response content as JSON. By default, the entire contents of the model map "
"(with the exception of framework-specific classes) are encoded as JSON. For "
"cases where the contents of the map need to be filtered, you can specify a "
"specific set of model attributes to encode by using the `modelKeys` "
"property. You can also use the `extractValueFromSingleKeyModel` property to "
"have the value in single-key models extracted and serialized directly rather "
"than as a map of model attributes."
