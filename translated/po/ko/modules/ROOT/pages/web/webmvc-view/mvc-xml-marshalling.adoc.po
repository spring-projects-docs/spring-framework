"The `MarshallingView` uses an XML `Marshaller` (defined in the "
"`org.springframework.oxm` package) to render the response content as "
"XML. You can explicitly set the object to be marshalled by using a "
"`MarshallingView` instance's `modelKey` bean property. Alternatively, the "
"view iterates over all model properties and marshals the first type that is "
"supported by the `Marshaller`. For more information on the functionality in "
"the `org.springframework.oxm` package, see "
"xref:data-access/oxm.adoc[Marshalling XML using O/X Mappers]."
