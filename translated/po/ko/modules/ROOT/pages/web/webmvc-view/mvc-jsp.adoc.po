"A key principle of REST is the use of the \"`Uniform Interface`\". This "
"means that all resources (URLs) can be manipulated by using the same four "
"HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. For each method, the HTTP "
"specification defines the exact semantics. For instance, a GET should always "
"be a safe operation, meaning that it has no side effects, and a PUT or "
"DELETE should be idempotent, meaning that you can repeat these operations "
"over and over again, but the end result should be the same. While HTTP "
"defines these four methods, HTML only supports two: GET and "
"POST. Fortunately, there are two possible workarounds: you can either use "
"JavaScript to do your PUT or DELETE, or you can do a POST with the "
"\"`real`\" method as an additional parameter (modeled as a hidden input "
"field in an HTML form). Spring's `HiddenHttpMethodFilter` uses this latter "
"trick. This filter is a plain Servlet filter and, therefore, it can be used "
"in combination with any web framework (not just Spring MVC). Add this filter "
"to your web.xml, and a POST with a hidden `method` parameter is converted "
"into the corresponding HTTP method request."
