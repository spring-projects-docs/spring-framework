"A `ResponseEntity<Resource>` can be returned for file content, copying the "
"`InputStream` content of the provided resource to the response "
"`OutputStream`. Note that the `InputStream` should be lazily retrieved by "
"the `Resource` handle in order to reliably close it after it has been copied "
"to the response. If you are using `InputStreamResource` for such a purpose, "
"make sure to construct it with an on-demand `InputStreamSource` (for "
"example, through a lambda expression that retrieves the actual "
"`InputStream`). Also, custom subclasses of `InputStreamResource` are only "
"supported in combination with a custom `contentLength()` implementation "
"which avoids consuming the stream for that purpose."
