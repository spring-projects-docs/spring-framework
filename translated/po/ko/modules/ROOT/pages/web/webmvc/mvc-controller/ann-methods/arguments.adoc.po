"| Controller method argument | Description\n"
"\n"
"| `WebRequest`, `NativeWebRequest`\n"
"| Generic access to request parameters and request and session attributes, "
"without direct\n"
"  use of the Servlet API.\n"
"\n"
"| `jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest`, `jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse`\n"
"| Choose any specific request or response type -- for example, "
"`ServletRequest`, `HttpServletRequest`,\n"
"  or Spring's `MultipartRequest`, `MultipartHttpServletRequest`.\n"
"\n"
"| `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession`\n"
"| Enforces the presence of a session. As a consequence, such an argument is "
"never `null`.\n"
"  Note that session access is not thread-safe. Consider setting the\n"
"  `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` instance's `synchronizeOnSession` flag to "
"`true` if multiple\n"
"  requests are allowed to concurrently access a session.\n"
"\n"
"| `jakarta.servlet.http.PushBuilder`\n"
"| Servlet 4.0 push builder API for programmatic HTTP/2 resource pushes.\n"
"  Note that this API has been deprecated as of Servlet 6.1.\n"
"\n"
"| `java.security.Principal`\n"
"| Currently authenticated user -- possibly a specific `Principal` "
"implementation class if known.\n"
"\n"
"  Note that this argument is not resolved eagerly, if it is annotated in "
"order to allow a custom resolver to resolve it\n"
"  before falling back on default resolution via "
"`HttpServletRequest#getUserPrincipal`.\n"
"  For example, the Spring Security `Authentication` implements `Principal` "
"and would be injected as such via\n"
"  `HttpServletRequest#getUserPrincipal`, unless it is also annotated with "
"`@AuthenticationPrincipal` in which case it\n"
"  is resolved by a custom Spring Security resolver through "
"`Authentication#getPrincipal`.\n"
"\n"
"| `HttpMethod`\n"
"| The HTTP method of the request.\n"
"\n"
"| `java.util.Locale`\n"
"| The current request locale, determined by the most specific "
"`LocaleResolver` available (in\n"
"  effect, the configured `LocaleResolver` or `LocaleContextResolver`).\n"
"\n"
"| `java.util.TimeZone` + `java.time.ZoneId`\n"
"| The time zone associated with the current request, as determined by a "
"`LocaleContextResolver`.\n"
"\n"
"| `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.Reader`\n"
"| For access to the raw request body as exposed by the Servlet API.\n"
"\n"
"| `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.Writer`\n"
"| For access to the raw response body as exposed by the Servlet API.\n"
"\n"
"| `@PathVariable`\n"
"| For access to URI template variables. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-uri-templates[URI "
"patterns].\n"
"\n"
"| `@MatrixVariable`\n"
"| For access to name-value pairs in URI path segments. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.adoc[Matrix "
"Variables].\n"
"\n"
"| `@RequestParam`\n"
"| For access to the Servlet request parameters, including multipart "
"files. Parameter values\n"
"  are converted to the declared method argument type. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestparam.adoc[`@RequestParam`] "
"as well\n"
"  as "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.adoc[Multipart].\n"
"\n"
"  Note that use of `@RequestParam` is optional for simple parameter "
"values.\n"
"  See \"`Any other argument`\", at the end of this table.\n"
"\n"
"| `@RequestHeader`\n"
"| For access to request headers. Header values are converted to the declared "
"method argument\n"
"  type. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestheader.adoc[`@RequestHeader`].\n"
"\n"
"| `@CookieValue`\n"
"| For access to cookies. Cookies values are converted to the declared method "
"argument\n"
"  type. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.adoc[`@CookieValue`].\n"
"\n"
"| `@RequestBody`\n"
"| For access to the HTTP request body. Body content is converted to the "
"declared method\n"
"  argument type by using `HttpMessageConverter` implementations. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.adoc[`@RequestBody`].\n"
"\n"
"| `HttpEntity<B>`\n"

"`HttpMessageConverter`.\n"

"| `@RequestPart`\n"

"\n"
"| `java.util.Map`, `org.springframework.ui.Model`, "
"`org.springframework.ui.ModelMap`\n"
"| For access to the model that is used in HTML controllers and exposed to "

"\n"
"| `RedirectAttributes`\n"
"| Specify attributes to use in case of a redirect (that is, to be appended "

"attributes).\n"
"  See \"`Any other argument`\" at the end of this table.\n"
"\n"
"| `Errors`, `BindingResult`\n"
"| For access to errors from validation and data binding for a command "
"object\n"
"  (that is, a `@ModelAttribute` argument) or errors from the validation of a "
