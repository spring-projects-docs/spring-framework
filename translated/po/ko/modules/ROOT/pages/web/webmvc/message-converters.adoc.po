"| MessageConverter | Description\n"
"\n"
"| `StringHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write `String` "
"instances from the HTTP request and response.\n"
"By default, this converter supports all text media types(`text/{asterisk}`) "
"and writes with a `Content-Type` of `text/plain`.\n"
"\n"
"| `FormHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write form data "
"from the HTTP request and response.\n"
"By default, this converter reads and writes the "
"`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type.\n"
"Form data is read from and written into a `MultiValueMap<String, String>`.\n"
"The converter can also write (but not read) multipart data read from a "
"`MultiValueMap<String, Object>`.\n"
"By default, `multipart/form-data` is supported.\n"
"Additional multipart subtypes can be supported for writing form data.\n"
"Consult the javadoc for `FormHttpMessageConverter` for further details.\n"
"\n"
"| `ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write byte "
"arrays from the HTTP request and response.\n"
"By default, this converter supports all media types "
"(`{asterisk}/{asterisk}`) and writes with a `Content-Type` of "
"`application/octet-stream`.\n"
"You can override this by setting the `supportedMediaTypes` property and "
"overriding `getContentType(byte[])`.\n"
"\n"
"| `MarshallingHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write XML by "
"using Spring's `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` abstractions from the "
"`org.springframework.oxm` package.\n"
"This converter requires a `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` before it can be "
"used.\n"
"You can inject these through constructor or bean properties.\n"
"By default, this converter supports `text/xml` and `application/xml`.\n"
"\n"
"| `JacksonJsonHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write JSON by "
"using Jackson's `JsonMapper`.\n"
"You can customize JSON mapping as needed through the use of Jackson's "
"provided annotations.\n"
"When you need further control (for cases where custom JSON "
"serializers/deserializers need to be provided for specific types), you can "
"inject a custom `JsonMapper` through the `JsonMapper` or `JsonMapper.Builder "
"` constructor parameters.\n"
"By default, this converter supports `application/json`. This requires the "
"`tools.jackson.core:jackson-databind` dependency.\n"
"\n"
"| `JacksonXmlHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write XML by "
"using {jackson-github-org}/jackson-dataformat-xml[Jackson XML] extension's "
"`XmlMapper`.\n"
"You can customize XML mapping as needed through the use of JAXB or Jackson's "
"provided annotations.\n"
"When you need further control (for cases where custom XML "
"serializers/deserializers need to be provided for specific types), you can "
"inject a custom `XmlMapper` through the `JsonMapper` or `JsonMapper.Builder` "
"constructor parameters.\n"
"By default, this converter supports `application/xml`. This requires the "
"`tools.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml` dependency.\n"
"\n"
"| `KotlinSerializationJsonHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write JSON "
"using `kotlinx.serialization`.\n"
"This converter is not configured by default, as this conflicts with "
"Jackson.\n"
"Developers must configure it as an additional converter ahead of the Jackson "
"one.\n"
"\n"
"| `JacksonCborHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| `tools.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-cbor`\n"
"\n"
"| `SourceHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write "
"`javax.xml.transform.Source` from the HTTP request and response.\n"
"Only `DOMSource`, `SAXSource`, and `StreamSource` are supported.\n"
"By default, this converter supports `text/xml` and `application/xml`.\n"
"\n"
"| `GsonHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write JSON by "
"using \"Google Gson\".\n"
"This requires the `com.google.code.gson:gson` dependency.\n"
"\n"
"| `JsonbHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write JSON by "
"using the Jakarta Json Bind API.\n"
"This requires the `jakarta.json.bind:jakarta.json.bind-api` dependency and "
"an implementation available.\n"
"\n"
"| `ProtobufHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write Protobuf "
"messages in binary format with the `\"application/x-protobuf\"`\n"
"content type. This requires the `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java` "
"dependency.\n"
"\n"
"| `ProtobufJsonFormatHttpMessageConverter`\n"
"| An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write JSON "
"documents to and from Protobuf messages.\n"
