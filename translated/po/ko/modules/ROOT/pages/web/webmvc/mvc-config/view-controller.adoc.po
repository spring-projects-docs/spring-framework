"If an `@RequestMapping` method is mapped to a URL for any HTTP method then a "
"view controller cannot be used to handle the same URL. This is because a "
"match by URL to an annotated controller is considered a strong enough "
"indication of endpoint ownership so that a 405 (METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED), a 415 "
"(UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE), or similar response can be sent to the client to "
"help with debugging. For this reason it is recommended to avoid splitting "
"URL handling across an annotated controller and a view controller."
