"The `DispatcherServlet` delegates to special beans to process requests and "

"Spring-managed `Object` instances that implement framework contracts. Those "
"usually come with built-in contracts, but you can customize their properties "
"and extend or replace them."

"| Map a request to a handler along with a list of\n"

"for pre- and post-processing.\n"
"  The mapping is based on some criteria, the details of which vary by "

"  implementation.\n"
"\n"
"  The two main `HandlerMapping` implementations are "
"`RequestMappingHandlerMapping`\n"

"| Help the `DispatcherServlet` to invoke a handler mapped to a request, "
"regardless of\n"
"  how the handler is actually invoked. For example, invoking an annotated "
"controller\n"
"  requires resolving annotations. The main purpose of a `HandlerAdapter` "
"is\n"
"  to shield the `DispatcherServlet` from such details.\n"
