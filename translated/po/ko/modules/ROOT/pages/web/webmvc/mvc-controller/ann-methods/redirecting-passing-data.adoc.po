"Appending primitive type attributes as query parameters can be the desired "
"result if a model instance was prepared specifically for the "
"redirect. However, in annotated controllers, the model can contain "
"additional attributes added for rendering purposes (for example, drop-down "
"field values). To avoid the possibility of having such attributes appear in "
"the URL, a `@RequestMapping` method can declare an argument of type "
"`RedirectAttributes` and use it to specify the exact attributes to make "
"available to `RedirectView`. If the method does redirect, the content of "
"`RedirectAttributes` is used.  Otherwise, the content of the model is used."

"The `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` provides a flag called "
"`ignoreDefaultModelOnRedirect`, which you can use to indicate that the "
"content of the default `Model` should never be used if a controller method "
"redirects. Instead, the controller method should declare an attribute of "
"type `RedirectAttributes` or, if it does not do so, no attributes should be "
"passed on to `RedirectView`. Both the MVC namespace and the MVC Java "
"configuration keep this flag set to `false`, to maintain backwards "
"compatibility.  However, for new applications, we recommend setting it to "
"`true`."
