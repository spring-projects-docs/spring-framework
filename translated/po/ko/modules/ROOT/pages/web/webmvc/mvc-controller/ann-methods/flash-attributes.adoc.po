"Flash attributes provide a way for one request to store attributes that are "
"intended for use in another. This is most commonly needed when redirecting "
"-- for example, the Post-Redirect-Get pattern. Flash attributes are saved "
"temporarily before the redirect (typically in the session) to be made "
"available to the request after the redirect and are removed immediately."

"Spring MVC has two main abstractions in support of flash "
"attributes. `FlashMap` is used to hold flash attributes, while "
"`FlashMapManager` is used to store, retrieve, and manage `FlashMap` "
"instances."

"Flash attribute support is always \"`on`\" and does not need to be enabled "
"explicitly.  However, if not used, it never causes HTTP session creation. On "
"each request, there is an \"`input`\" `FlashMap` with attributes passed from "
"a previous request (if any) and an \"`output`\" `FlashMap` with attributes "
"to save for a subsequent request. Both `FlashMap` instances are accessible "
"from anywhere in Spring MVC through static methods in `RequestContextUtils`."

"Annotated controllers typically do not need to work with `FlashMap` "
"directly. Instead, a `@RequestMapping` method can accept an argument of type "
"`RedirectAttributes` and use it to add flash attributes for a redirect "
"scenario. Flash attributes added through `RedirectAttributes` are "
"automatically propagated to the \"`output`\" FlashMap. Similarly, after the "
"redirect, attributes from the \"`input`\" `FlashMap` are automatically added "
"to the `Model` of the controller that serves the target URL."

"The concept of flash attributes exists in many other web frameworks and has "
"proven to sometimes be exposed to concurrency issues. This is because, by "
"definition, flash attributes are to be stored until the next "
"request. However the very \"`next`\" request may not be the intended "
"recipient but another asynchronous request (for example, polling or resource "
"requests), in which case the flash attributes are removed too early."

"To reduce the possibility of such issues, `RedirectView` automatically "
"\"`stamps`\" `FlashMap` instances with the path and query parameters of the "

"`FlashMap`."

"This does not entirely eliminate the possibility of a concurrency issue but "
