"Spring MVC allows for mapping the `DispatcherServlet` to `/` (thus "
"overriding the mapping of the container's default Servlet), while still "
"allowing static resource requests to be handled by the container's default "
"Servlet. It configures a `DefaultServletHttpRequestHandler` with a URL "
"mapping of `/**` and the lowest priority relative to other URL mappings."

"This handler forwards all requests to the default Servlet. Therefore, it "
"must remain last in the order of all other URL `HandlerMappings`. That is "
"the case if you use `<mvc:annotation-driven>`. Alternatively, if you set up "
"your own customized `HandlerMapping` instance, be sure to set its `order` "
"property to a value lower than that of the "
"`DefaultServletHttpRequestHandler`, which is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`."

"The caveat to overriding the `/` Servlet mapping is that the "
"`RequestDispatcher` for the default Servlet must be retrieved by name rather "
"than by path. The `DefaultServletHttpRequestHandler` tries to auto-detect "
"the default Servlet for the container at startup time, using a list of known "
"names for most of the major Servlet containers (including Tomcat, Jetty, "
"GlassFish, JBoss, WebLogic, and WebSphere).  If the default Servlet has been "
"custom-configured with a different name, or if a different Servlet container "
"is being used where the default Servlet name is unknown, then you must "
"explicitly provide the default Servlet's name, as the following example "
"shows:"
