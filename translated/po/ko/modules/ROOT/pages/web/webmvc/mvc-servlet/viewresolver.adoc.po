"Spring MVC defines the `ViewResolver` and `View` interfaces that let you "

"| ViewResolver| Description\n"
"\n"
"| `AbstractCachingViewResolver`\n"
"| Subclasses of `AbstractCachingViewResolver` cache view instances that they "
"resolve.\n"
"  Caching improves performance of certain view technologies. You can turn "
"off the\n"
"  cache by setting the `cache` property to `false`. Furthermore, if you must "
"refresh\n"
"  a certain view at runtime (for example, when a FreeMarker template is "
"modified),\n"
"  you can use the `removeFromCache(String viewName, Locale loc)` method.\n"
"\n"
"| `UrlBasedViewResolver`\n"
"| Simple implementation of the `ViewResolver` interface that effects the "
"direct\n"
"  resolution of logical view names to URLs without an explicit mapping "
"definition.\n"
"  This is appropriate if your logical names match the names of your view "
"resources\n"
"  in a straightforward manner, without the need for arbitrary mappings.\n"
"\n"
"| `InternalResourceViewResolver`\n"
"| Convenient subclass of `UrlBasedViewResolver` that supports "
"`InternalResourceView` (in\n"
"  effect, Servlets and JSPs) and subclasses such as `JstlView`. You can "
"specify the view\n"
"  class for all views generated by this resolver by using "
"`setViewClass(..)`.\n"
"  See the "
"{spring-framework-api}/web/reactive/result/view/UrlBasedViewResolver.html[`UrlBasedViewResolver`]\n"
"  javadoc for details.\n"
"\n"
"| `FreeMarkerViewResolver`\n"
"| Convenient subclass of `UrlBasedViewResolver` that supports "
"`FreeMarkerView` and\n"
"  custom subclasses of them.\n"
"\n"
"| `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver`\n"
"| Implementation of the `ViewResolver` interface that resolves a view based "
"on the\n"
"  request file name or `Accept` header. See "
"xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.adoc#mvc-multiple-representations[Content "
"Negotiation].\n"
"\n"
"| `BeanNameViewResolver`\n"
"| Implementation of the `ViewResolver` interface that interprets a view name "
"as a\n"
"  bean name in the current application context. This is a very flexible "
"variant which\n"
"  allows for mixing and matching different view types based on distinct view "
"names.\n"
"  Each such `View` can be defined as a bean, for example, in XML or in "
"configuration classes.\n"
