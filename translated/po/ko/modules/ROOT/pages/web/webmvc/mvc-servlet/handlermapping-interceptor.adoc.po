"For `@ResponseBody` and `ResponseEntity` controller methods, the response is "

"Interceptors are not ideally suited as a security layer due to the potential "

"recommend using Spring Security, or alternatively a similar approach "
"integrated with the Servlet filter chain, and applied as early as possible."
