"Spring MVC, as many other web frameworks, is designed around the front "
"controller pattern where a central `Servlet`, the `DispatcherServlet`, "
"provides a shared algorithm for request processing, while actual work is "
"performed by configurable delegate components.  This model is flexible and "
"supports diverse workflows."

"The `DispatcherServlet`, as any `Servlet`, needs to be declared and mapped "
"according to the Servlet specification by using Java configuration or in "
"`web.xml`.  In turn, the `DispatcherServlet` uses Spring configuration to "
"discover the delegate components it needs for request mapping, view "
"resolution, exception handling, "

"Spring Boot follows a different initialization sequence. Rather than hooking "
"into the lifecycle of the Servlet container, Spring Boot uses Spring "
"configuration to bootstrap itself and the embedded Servlet "
"container. `Filter` and `Servlet` declarations are detected in Spring "
"configuration and registered with the Servlet container.  For more details, "
