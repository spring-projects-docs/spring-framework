"`DispatcherServlet` expects a `WebApplicationContext` (an extension of a "
"plain `ApplicationContext`) for its own "
"configuration. `WebApplicationContext` has a link to the `ServletContext` "
"and the `Servlet` with which it is associated. It is also bound to the "
"`ServletContext` such that applications can use static methods on "
"`RequestContextUtils` to look up the `WebApplicationContext` if they need "
"access to it."

"For many applications, having a single `WebApplicationContext` is simple and "
"suffices.  It is also possible to have a context hierarchy where one root "
"`WebApplicationContext` is shared across multiple `DispatcherServlet` (or "
"other `Servlet`) instances, each with its own child `WebApplicationContext` "
"configuration.  See xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc[Additional "
"Capabilities of the `ApplicationContext`] for more on the context hierarchy "
"feature."

"The root `WebApplicationContext` typically contains infrastructure beans, "
"such as data repositories and business services that need to be shared "
"across multiple `Servlet` instances. Those beans are effectively inherited "
"and can be overridden (that is, re-declared) in the Servlet-specific child "
"`WebApplicationContext`, which typically contains beans local to the given "
"`Servlet`.  The following image shows this relationship:"
