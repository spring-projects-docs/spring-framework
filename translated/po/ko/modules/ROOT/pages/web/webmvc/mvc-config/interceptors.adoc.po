"Interceptors are not ideally suited as a security layer due to the potential "
"for a mismatch with annotated controller path matching. Generally, we "
"recommend using Spring Security, or alternatively a similar approach "
"integrated with the Servlet filter chain, and applied as early as possible."

"The XML config declares interceptors as `MappedInterceptor` beans, and those "
"are in turn detected by any `HandlerMapping` bean, including those from "
"other frameworks.  By contrast, the Java config passes interceptors only to "
"the `HandlerMapping` beans it manages.  To re-use the same interceptors "
"across Spring MVC and other framework `HandlerMapping` beans with the MVC "
"Java config, either declare `MappedInterceptor` beans (and don't manually "
"add them in the Java config), or configure the same interceptors in both the "
"Java config and in other `HandlerMapping` beans."
