"| Parameter| Explanation\n"
"\n"
"| `contextClass`\n"
"| Class that implements `ConfigurableWebApplicationContext`, to be "
"instantiated and\n"
"  locally configured by this Servlet. By default, `XmlWebApplicationContext` "
"is used.\n"
"\n"
"| `contextConfigLocation`\n"
"| String that is passed to the context instance (specified by "
"`contextClass`) to\n"
"  indicate where contexts can be found. The string consists potentially of "
"multiple\n"
"  strings (using a comma as a delimiter) to support multiple contexts. In "
"the case of\n"
"  multiple context locations with beans that are defined twice, the latest "

"| `namespace`\n"

"| `throwExceptionIfNoHandlerFound`\n"
