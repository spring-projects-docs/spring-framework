"HTTP caching can significantly improve the performance of a web "
"application. HTTP caching revolves around the `Cache-Control` response "
"header and subsequent conditional request headers, such as `Last-Modified` "
"and `ETag`. `Cache-Control` advises private (for example, browser)  and "
"public (for example, proxy) caches how to cache and re-use responses. An "
"`ETag` header is used to make a conditional request that may result in a 304 "
"(NOT_MODIFIED) without a body, if the content has not changed. `ETag` can be "
"seen as a more sophisticated successor to the `Last-Modified` header."
