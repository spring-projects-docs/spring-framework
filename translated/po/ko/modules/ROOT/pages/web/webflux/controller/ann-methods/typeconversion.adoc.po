"Some annotated controller method arguments that represent String-based "
"request input (for example, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestHeader`, "
"`@PathVariable`, `@MatrixVariable`, and `@CookieValue`)  can require type "
"conversion if the argument is declared as something other than `String`."

"For such cases, type conversion is automatically applied based on the "
"configured converters.  By default, simple types (such as `int`, `long`, "
"`Date`, and others) are supported. Type conversion can be customized through "
"a `WebDataBinder` (see "
"xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.adoc[`DataBinder`])  or by "
"registering `Formatters` with the `FormattingConversionService` (see "
"xref:core/validation/format.adoc[Spring Field Formatting])."

"A practical issue in type conversion is the treatment of an empty String "
"source value.  Such a value is treated as missing if it becomes `null` as a "
"result of type conversion.  This can be the case for `Long`, `UUID`, and "
"other target types. If you want to allow `null` to be injected, either use "
"the `required` flag on the argument annotation, or declare the argument as "
"`@Nullable`."
