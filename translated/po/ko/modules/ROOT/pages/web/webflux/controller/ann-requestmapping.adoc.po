"While the main purpose of `@HttpExchange` is for an HTTP Service "
"xref:integration/rest-clients.adoc#rest-http-service-client[client with a "
"generated proxy], the HTTP Service interface on which such annotations are "
"placed is a contract neutral to client vs server use. In addition to "
"simplifying client code, there are also cases where an HTTP Service "
"interface may be a convenient way for servers to expose their API for client "
"access. This leads to increased coupling between client and server and is "
"often not a good choice, especially for public API's, but may be exactly the "
"goal for an internal API. It is an approach commonly used in Spring Cloud, "
"and it is why `@HttpExchange` is supported as an alternative to "
"`@RequestMapping` for server side handling in controller classes."
