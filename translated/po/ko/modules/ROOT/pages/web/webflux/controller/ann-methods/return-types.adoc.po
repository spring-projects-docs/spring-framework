"For return types like `Flux`, when multiple values are expected, elements "
"are streamed as they come and are not buffered. This is the default "
"behavior, as keeping a potentially large amount of elements in memory is not "
"efficient. If the media type implies an infinite stream (for example, "
"`application/json+stream`), values are written and flushed "
"individually. Otherwise, values are written individually and the flushing "
"happens separately."

"If an error happens while an element is encoded to JSON, the response might "
"have been written to and committed already and it is impossible at that "
"point to render a proper error response.  In some cases, applications can "
"choose to trade memory efficiency for better handling such errors by "
"buffering elements and encoding them all at once. Controllers can then "
"return a `Flux<List<B>>`; Reactor provides a dedicated operator for that, "
"`Flux#collectList()`."
