"Dependency injection should make your code less dependent on the container "
"than it would be with traditional J2EE / Java EE development. The POJOs that "
"make up your application should be testable in JUnit or TestNG tests, with "
"objects instantiated by using the `new` operator, without Spring or any "
"other container. You can use xref:testing/unit.adoc#mock-objects[mock "
"objects] (in conjunction with other valuable testing techniques) to test "
"your code in isolation.  If you follow the architecture recommendations for "
"Spring, the resulting clean layering and componentization of your codebase "
"facilitate easier unit testing. For example, you can test service layer "
"objects by stubbing or mocking DAO or repository interfaces, without needing "
"to access persistent data while running unit tests."

"your IoC-based applications. For certain unit testing scenarios, however, "
