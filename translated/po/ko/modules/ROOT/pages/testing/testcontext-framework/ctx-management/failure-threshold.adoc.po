"As of Spring Framework 6.1, a context _failure threshold_ policy is in place "
"which helps avoid repeated attempts to load a failing "
"`ApplicationContext`. By default, the failure threshold is set to `1` which "
"means that only one attempt will be made to load an `ApplicationContext` for "
"a given context cache key (see "
"xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.adoc[Context "
"Caching]). Any subsequent attempt to load the `ApplicationContext` for the "
"same context cache key will result in an immediate `IllegalStateException` "
"with an error message which explains that the attempt was preemptively "
"skipped. This behavior allows individual test classes and test suites to "
"fail faster by avoiding repeated attempts to load an `ApplicationContext` "
"that will never successfully load -- for example, due to a configuration "
"error or a missing external resource that prevents the context from loading "
"in the current environment."

"You can configure the context failure threshold from the command line or a "
"build script by setting a JVM system property named "
"`spring.test.context.failure.threshold` with a positive integer value. As an "
"alternative, you can set the same property via the "
"xref:appendix.adoc#appendix-spring-properties[`SpringProperties`] mechanism."

"If you wish to effectively disable the context failure threshold, you can "
"set the property to a very large value. For example, from the command line "
"you could set the system property via "
"`-Dspring.test.context.failure.threshold=1000000`."
