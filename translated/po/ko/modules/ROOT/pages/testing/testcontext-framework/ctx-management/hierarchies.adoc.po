"When writing integration tests that rely on a loaded Spring "
"`ApplicationContext`, it is often sufficient to test against a single "
"context. However, there are times when it is beneficial or even necessary to "
"test against a hierarchy of `ApplicationContext` instances. For example, if "
"you are developing a Spring MVC web application, you typically have a root "
"`WebApplicationContext` loaded by Spring's `ContextLoaderListener` and a "
"child `WebApplicationContext` loaded by Spring's `DispatcherServlet`. This "
"results in a parent-child context hierarchy where shared components and "
"infrastructure configuration are declared in the root context and consumed "
"in the child context by web-specific components. Another use case can be "
"found in Spring Batch applications, where you often have a parent context "
"that provides configuration for shared batch infrastructure and a child "
"context for the configuration of a specific batch job."

"You can write integration tests that use context hierarchies by declaring "
"context configuration with the `@ContextHierarchy` annotation, either on an "
"individual test class or within a test class hierarchy. If a context "
"hierarchy is declared on multiple classes within a test class hierarchy, you "
"can also merge or override the context configuration for a specific, named "
"level in the context hierarchy. When merging configuration for a given level "
"in the hierarchy, the configuration resource type (that is, XML "
"configuration files or component classes) must be consistent. Otherwise, it "
"is perfectly acceptable to have different levels in a context hierarchy "
"configured using different resource types."
