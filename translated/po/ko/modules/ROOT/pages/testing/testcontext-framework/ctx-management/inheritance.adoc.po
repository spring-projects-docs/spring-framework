"`@ContextConfiguration` supports boolean `inheritLocations` and "
"`inheritInitializers` attributes that denote whether resource locations or "
"component classes and context initializers declared by superclasses should "
"be inherited. The default value for both flags is `true`. This means that a "
"test class inherits the resource locations or component classes as well as "
"the context initializers declared by any superclasses.  Specifically, the "
"resource locations or component classes for a test class are appended to the "
"list of resource locations or annotated classes declared by superclasses.  "
"Similarly, the initializers for a given test class are added to the set of "
"initializers defined by test superclasses. Thus, subclasses have the option "
"of extending the resource locations, component classes, or context "
"initializers."
