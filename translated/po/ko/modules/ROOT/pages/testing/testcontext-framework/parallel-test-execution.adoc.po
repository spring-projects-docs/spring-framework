"The Spring TestContext Framework provides basic support for executing tests "
"in parallel within a single JVM. In general, this means that most test "

"Parallel test execution in the Spring TestContext Framework is only possible "

"as explained in the javadoc for "
"{spring-framework-api}/test/context/TestContext.html[`TestContext`]. The "
"`DefaultTestContext` used in Spring provides such a constructor. However, if "
"you use a third-party library that provides a custom `TestContext` "
"implementation, you need to verify that it is suitable for parallel test "
"execution."
