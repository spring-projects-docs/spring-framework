"For example, if `TestClassA` specifies `{\"app-config.xml\", "
"\"test-config.xml\"}` for the `locations` (or `value`) attribute of "
"`@ContextConfiguration`, the TestContext framework loads the corresponding "
"`ApplicationContext` and stores it in a `static` context cache under a key "
"that is based solely on those locations. So, if `TestClassB` also defines "
"`{\"app-config.xml\", \"test-config.xml\"}` for its locations (either "
"explicitly or implicitly through inheritance) but does not define "
"`@WebAppConfiguration`, a different `ContextLoader`, different active "
"profiles, different context initializers, different context customizers, "
"different test or dynamic property sources, or a different parent context, "
"then the same `ApplicationContext` is shared by both test classes. This "
"means that the setup cost for loading an application context is incurred "
"only once (per test suite), and subsequent test execution is much faster."

"To benefit from the caching mechanism, all tests must run within the same "

"for the Maven Surefire plug-in is set to `always` or `pertest`, the "
"TestContext framework cannot cache application contexts between test "
