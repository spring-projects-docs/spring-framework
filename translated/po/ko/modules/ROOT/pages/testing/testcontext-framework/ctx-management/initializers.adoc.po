"To configure an `ApplicationContext` for your tests by using context "
"initializers, annotate your test class with `@ContextConfiguration` and "
"configure the `initializers` attribute with an array that contains "
"references to classes that implement `ApplicationContextInitializer`. The "
"declared context initializers are then used to initialize the "
"`ConfigurableApplicationContext` that is loaded for your tests. Note that "
"the concrete `ConfigurableApplicationContext` type supported by each "
"declared initializer must be compatible with the type of "
"`ApplicationContext` created by the `SmartContextLoader` in use (typically a "
"`GenericApplicationContext`). Furthermore, the order in which the "
"initializers are invoked depends on whether they implement Spring's "
"`Ordered` interface or are annotated with Spring's `@Order` annotation or "
"the standard `@Priority` annotation. The following example shows how to use "
"initializers:"
