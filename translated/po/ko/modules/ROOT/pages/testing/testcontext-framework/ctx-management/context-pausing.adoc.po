"As of Spring Framework 7.0, an `ApplicationContext` stored in the context "
"cache (see "
"xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.adoc[Context "
"Caching]) may be _paused_ when it is no longer actively in use and "
"automatically _restarted_ the next time the context is retrieved from the "
"cache. Specifically, the latter will restart all auto-startup beans in the "
"application context, effectively restoring the lifecycle state.  This "
"ensures that background processes within the context are not actively "
"running while the context is not used by tests. For example, JMS listener "
"containers, scheduled tasks, and any other components in the context that "
"implement `Lifecycle` or `SmartLifecycle` will be in a \"stopped\" state "
"until the context is used again by a test. Note, however, that "
"`SmartLifecycle` components can opt out of pausing by returning `false` from "
"`SmartLifecycle#isPauseable()`."
