"When you use the `DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener` (which is "
"configured by default), the dependencies of your test instances are injected "
"from beans in the application context that you configured with "
"`@ContextConfiguration` or related annotations. You may use setter "
"injection, field injection, or both, depending on which annotations you "
"choose and whether you place them on setter methods or fields.  If you are "
"using JUnit Jupiter you may also optionally use constructor injection (see "
"xref:testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.adoc#testcontext-junit-jupiter-di[Dependency "
"Injection with `SpringExtension`]).  For consistency with Spring's "
"annotation-based injection support, you may also use Spring's `@Autowired` "
"annotation or the `@Inject` annotation from JSR-330 for field and setter "
"injection."

"For testing frameworks other than JUnit Jupiter, the TestContext framework "

"Although field injection is discouraged in production code, field injection "
"is actually quite natural in test code. The rationale for the difference is "
"that you will never instantiate your test class directly. Consequently, "
"there is no need to be able to invoke a `public` constructor or setter "
"method on your test class."

"Because `@Autowired` is used to perform "
"xref:core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.adoc[autowiring by type] , if "
"you have multiple bean definitions of the same type, you cannot rely on this "
"approach for those particular beans. In that case, you can use `@Autowired` "
"in conjunction with `@Qualifier`. You can also choose to use `@Inject` in "
"conjunction with `@Named`. Alternatively, if your test class has access to "
"its `ApplicationContext`, you can perform an explicit lookup by using (for "
"example) a call to `applicationContext.getBean(\"titleRepository\", "
"TitleRepository.class)`."
