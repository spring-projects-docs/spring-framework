"These events may be consumed for various reasons, such as resetting mock "
"beans or tracing test execution. One advantage of consuming test execution "
"events rather than implementing a custom `TestExecutionListener` is that "
"test execution events may be consumed by any Spring bean registered in the "
"test `ApplicationContext`, and such beans may benefit directly from "
"dependency injection and other features of the `ApplicationContext`. In "
"contrast, a `TestExecutionListener` is not a bean in the "
"`ApplicationContext`."

"In order to listen to test execution events, a Spring bean may choose to "
"implement the `org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener` "
"interface. Alternatively, listener methods can be annotated with "
"`@EventListener` and configured to listen to one of the particular event "
"types listed above (see "
"xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc#context-functionality-events-annotation[Annotation-based "
"Event Listeners]).  Due to the popularity of this approach, Spring provides "
"the following dedicated `@EventListener` annotations to simplify "
"registration of test execution event listeners.  These annotations reside in "
"the `org.springframework.test.context.event.annotation` package."
