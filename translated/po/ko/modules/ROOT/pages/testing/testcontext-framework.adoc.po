"The Spring TestContext Framework (located in the "
"`org.springframework.test.context` package) provides generic, "
"annotation-driven unit and integration testing support that is agnostic of "
"the testing framework in use. The TestContext framework also places a great "
"deal of importance on convention over configuration, with reasonable "
"defaults that you can override through annotation-based configuration."

"In addition to generic testing infrastructure, the TestContext framework "
"provides explicit support for JUnit Jupiter, JUnit 4, and TestNG. For JUnit "
"4 and TestNG, Spring provides `abstract` support classes. Furthermore, "
"Spring provides a custom JUnit `Runner` and custom JUnit `Rules` for JUnit 4 "
"and a custom `Extension` for JUnit Jupiter that let you write so-called POJO "
"test classes. POJO test classes are not required to extend a particular "
"class hierarchy, such as the `abstract` support classes."
