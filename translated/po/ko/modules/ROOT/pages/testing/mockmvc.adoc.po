"MockMvc provides support for testing Spring MVC applications. It performs "
"full Spring MVC request handling but via mock request and response objects "
"instead of a running server."

"MockMvc can be used on its own to perform requests and verify responses "
"using Hamcrest or through `MockMvcTester` which provides a fluent API using "
"AssertJ. It can also be used through the "
"xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[WebTestClient] where MockMvc is plugged in "
"as the server to handle requests. The advantage of using `WebTestClient` is "
"that it provides you the option of working with higher level objects instead "
"of raw data as well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests "
"against a live server and use the same test API."
