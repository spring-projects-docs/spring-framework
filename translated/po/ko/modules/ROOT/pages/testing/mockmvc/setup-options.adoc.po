"A `WebApplicationContext`-based test loads your actual Spring MVC "
"configuration, resulting in a more complete integration test. Since the "
"TestContext framework caches the loaded Spring configuration, it helps keep "
"tests running fast, even as you introduce more tests in your test suite "
"using the same configuration. Furthermore, you can override services used by "
"your controller using `@MockitoBean` or `@TestBean` to remain focused on "
"testing the web layer."

"A standalone test, on the other hand, is a little closer to a unit test. It "
"tests one controller at a time. You can manually inject the controller with "
"mock dependencies, and it does not involve loading Spring "
"configuration. Such tests are more focused on style and make it easier to "
"see which controller is being tested, whether any specific Spring MVC "
"configuration is required to work, and so on. The standalone setup is also a "
"very convenient way to write ad-hoc tests to verify specific behavior or to "
"debug an issue."

"As with most \"integration versus unit testing\" debates, there is no right "
"or wrong answer. However, using standalone tests does imply the need for "
"additional integration tests to verify your Spring MVC "
"configuration. Alternatively, you can write all your tests with a "
"`WebApplicationContext`, so that they always test against your actual Spring "
"MVC configuration."
