"`MockMvcTester` provides a fluent API to compose the request that reuses the "
"same `MockHttpServletRequestBuilder` as the Hamcrest support, except that "
"there is no need to import a static method. The builder that is returned is "
"AssertJ-aware so that wrapping it in the regular `assertThat()` factory "
"method triggers the exchange and provides access to a dedicated Assert "
"object for `MvcTestResult`."

"AssertJ often consists of multiple `assertThat()` statements to validate the "
