"You can write plain unit tests for Spring MVC by instantiating a controller, "
"injecting it with dependencies, and calling its methods. However such tests "
"do not verify request mappings, data binding, message conversion, type "
"conversion, or validation and also do not involve any of the supporting "
"`@InitBinder`, `@ModelAttribute`, or `@ExceptionHandler` methods."

"`MockMvc` aims to provide more complete testing support for Spring MVC "
"controllers without a running server. It does that by invoking the "
"`DispatcherServlet` and passing "
"xref:testing/unit.adoc#mock-objects-servlet[\"mock\" implementations of the "
"Servlet API] from the `spring-test` module which replicates the full Spring "
"MVC request handling without a running server."

"MockMvc is a server-side test framework that lets you verify most of the "
"functionality of a Spring MVC application using lightweight and targeted "
"tests. You can use it on its own to perform requests and to verify responses "
"using Hamcrest or through `MockMvcTester` which provides a fluent API using "
"AssertJ. You can also use it through the "
"xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[WebTestClient] API with MockMvc plugged in "
"as the server to handle requests."
