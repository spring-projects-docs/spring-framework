"When used with JUnit Jupiter based tests, `@DisabledInAotMode` also signals "
"that the annotated test class or test method is disabled when running the "
"test suite in Spring AOT mode. When applied at the class level, all test "
"methods within that class will be disabled. In this sense, "
"`@DisabledInAotMode` has semantics similar to those of JUnit Jupiter's "
"`@DisabledInNativeImage` annotation."
