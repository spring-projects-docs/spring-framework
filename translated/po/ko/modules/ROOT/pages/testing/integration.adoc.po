"The Spring TestContext Framework provides consistent loading of Spring "
"`ApplicationContext` instances and `WebApplicationContext` instances as well "
"as caching of those contexts. Support for the caching of loaded contexts is "
"important, because startup time can become an issue -- not because of the "
"overhead of Spring itself, but because the objects instantiated by the "
"Spring container take time to instantiate. For example, a project with 50 to "
"100 Hibernate mapping files might take 10 to 20 seconds to load the mapping "
"files, and incurring that cost before running every test in every test "
"fixture leads to slower overall test runs that reduce developer "
"productivity."

"By default, once loaded, the configured `ApplicationContext` is reused for "
"each test.  Thus, the setup cost is incurred only once per test suite, and "
"subsequent test execution is much faster. In this context, the term \"`test "
"suite`\" means all tests run in the same JVM -- for example, all tests run "
"from an Ant, Maven, or Gradle build for a given project or module. In the "
"unlikely case that a test corrupts the application context and requires "
"reloading (for example, by modifying a bean definition or the state of an "
"application object) the TestContext framework can be configured to reload "
"the configuration and rebuild the application context before executing the "
